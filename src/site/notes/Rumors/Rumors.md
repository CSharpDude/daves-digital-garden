## The Disappearing Merchant
"One of the traders from Tharbad, he was, with a cart full of foreign wares. Came through here not a fortnight ago, and said he'd be staying at the Forsaken Inn on the Great East Road for the night, before heading back south. No one's seen hide nor hair of him since. They say the inn's been deserted for years, but he was adamant it's under new management. Some travelers claim to see lights in the windows from a distance, but the closer they get, everything goes dark. Folks are startin' to whisper about ghosts, or worse..."

## The Hoard of the Dragon Viglund 
"Legends tell of Viglund, a mighty dragon of the northern wastes, who vanished centuries ago. Many believe the beast is long dead, his bones buried beneath the ice and stone. Yet, the elderly sage in Tharbad claims to have translated ancient Rhudauran texts that speak of Viglund's lair, a cavern glittering with gold and jewels, beyond the Coldfells. However, beware, for if the dragon still lives, so does his unquenchable greed and fiery wrath."

## Orc Raiding Party
"Whispers wind their way through the settlements of Eriador, murmurings of an orc raiding party seen skulking through the Weather Hills. Villagers speak of seeing dark shapes moving with vile purpose under the cover of night, their guttural tongue echoing with malice in the downy pre-dawn hours. The folk of the region clutch their weapons close and cast wary eyes towards the horizon, fearing these prowling marauders might descend upon them as they have elsewhere, leaving only the ashes of homes and the sorrow of loss in their wake."

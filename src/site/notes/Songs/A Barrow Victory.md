_In the heart of battle, where darkness loomed,
Heroes stood tall, with Gilraen's light imbued.
With swords gleaming bright, and courage aflame,
They fought for freedom, a world untamed.

_Through Barrows dark, they ventured deep,
Where shadows whispered, and secrets did keep.
They faced the Wight, servant of the foe,
Their valor and strength, struck a mighty blow.

_With blades unsheathed, they clashed in the night,
Defying the darkness, embracing the light.
Their fellowship united, hearts beating strong,
They sang a song of victory, loud and long.

_From the ashes of battle, they emerged triumphant,
Their deeds etched in legends, forever resplendent.
The enemy's grip weakened, their spirits soared,
They stood as beacons, defenders of the sword.

_So raise your voices, let your song resound,
Of heroes bold, in victory crowned.
In the dim of darkness, they three stood tall,
Bold stories of their triumph, still told by all.

### Recap
In Session 14, the Fellowship embarked on their journey to the Chetwood, a dense forest east of Bree, in search of clues about the stolen Chronicles of AnnÃºminas. After a day of searching, they discovered a group of Hobbits who had encountered a band of cloaked men moving eastward. The Hobbits provided a drawing of the emblem on their cloaks, resembling the symbol of the Shadowwing Brotherhood. Galamdir identified this group as secretive and potentially allied with the enemy. The Fellowship decided to head towards the Trollshaws, where the Brotherhood was rumored to have a hidden enclave. They set up camp for the night and prepared to continue their quest in the morning.

### Carlson
November 1
We decided to look in on Carlson since we were passing by his farm. We found him working in the fields near his home. We exchanged greetings and asked him how they were getting on. 

" Well. Well. Thank you. Some rangers have been stopping by and there has been no more trouble from the tower. Why don't you come on inside and we'll fix you up a dinner. It ain't much but it'll fill your bellies. And you can sleep in the barn if you wish. Some rest your feet!"

And so we followed Carlson and had a nice supper. That night as we bedded down in the shelter of his barn, the weather turned dark and the wind began to howl. It seemed we heard strange voices carried on the wind. Voices that predicted doom to our company and we all felt a heavy sense of dread. Were we being watched?

> Company +1 shadow

We made excellent time on the East road after we left Carlson's farm and we decided to push on a little longer than usual. On the second day we stopped a bit later than usual, more weary than normal. Perhaps it was this weariness that led to our surprise.

As we were setting up camp, a dwarf with a murderous look in his eye jumped out of nearby bushes and set on Gorin. Wildly yelling some incoherent cry, the assassin swung his axe at Gorin's head. Just in time, Gorin ducked and rolled to the side! The axe dug in to the ground where just a second ago Gorin had stood. Alert now, we engaged this mad dwarf.

Gorin's axe swung quickly as he regained his feet, striking the ambusher squarely in the chest. He let out a loud grunt of pain as he was knocked back by the blow. Seeing the opening, I stabbed at him with Shadowbane and pierced his armor. The dwarf double over and dropped to the ground, dead.

We searched the dwarf's body and found not a clue as to why he attacked us (or was he attacking Gorin?). Galamdir then noticed the haft of his dagger. Engraved on the hilt was a simple raven. So, he was linked to the group we were seeking! But why would he attack alone? 

We were going to stay extra vigilant this night/ Galamdir took first watch.

> Company receives 1 extra fatigue

The next day we proceeded toward the Trollshaws and crossed into this dangerous forest on the second day,

As the company ventured deeper into the Trollshaws, their eyes were greeted by a breathtaking sight that filled their hearts with awe and wonder. The dense forest canopy suddenly opened up, revealing a hidden glade bathed in dappled sunlight. The air was filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers and the gentle melody of birdsong.

In the center of the glade stood a majestic waterfall, its crystal-clear waters cascading down from a towering cliff face. The sunlight caught the spray, creating a shimmering rainbow that arched over the waterfall, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the glade. The sound of rushing water filled the air, soothing and invigorating at the same time.

Surrounding the waterfall were ancient, towering trees, their branches reaching towards the heavens. Their leaves, a vibrant mix of greens and golds, rustled gently in the breeze, creating a soothing symphony of nature. The ground beneath the company's feet was carpeted with a lush, emerald-green moss, soft and inviting.

As the company approached the edge of the glade, they noticed a family of deer grazing peacefully nearby, undisturbed by their presence. The deer, their coats a mix of earthy browns and soft grays, moved with grace and elegance, their eyes reflecting a sense of tranquility.

Above, a pair of majestic eagles soared high in the sky, their wings outstretched as they ride the currents of wind. Their piercing cries echoed through the glade, a reminder of the untamed beauty and freedom that resides within the Trollshaws.

In this moment, the company was reminded of the enduring power and resilience of nature, and they found solace and inspiration in the harmonious coexistence of all living things within this hidden sanctuary. It is a sight that will forever remain etched in their memories, a testament to the wonders that can be found even in the most perilous of lands.

> Company gains 1 hope

In this oasis of hope, we set up camp, our spirits lifted from the oppression of the dark forest, if only for the evening. Tomorrow our search for the [[Adversaries/Shadowwing Brotherhood\|Shadowwing Brotherhood]]begins.

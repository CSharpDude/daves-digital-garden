### Recap
The company has found the lair of the [[Adversaries/Shadowwing Brotherhood\|Shadowwing Brotherhood]] in the Trollshaws. It is heavily guarded. In order to sneak into the hideout which is a crumbling tower, they decided to coerce a family of Trolls to attack them, and then lead the trolls to the hideout. They could then quietly sneak into the tower in the ensuing chaos.

### Log
A search of a nearby valley revealed the silhouette of a massive troll standing guard in front of dark cave. But after watching for a few minutes, the troll never moved. It had been turned to stone! Apparently it had been caught outside in the sun. We moved to carefully search his lair. Perhaps we could find evidence of additional trolls.

Gorin called out "Ho! Over here!" In a corner of the cave was a scrap heap. But not all was refuse - there was treasure too!

>Company gains 1 treasure each

We needed to keep searching for trolls, and night was fast approaching. As we exited the cave, I noticed there were two sets of troll tracks. Perhaps one set would lead us to another troll. 

We followed the tracks across the hills to find another cave. The tracks led into the dark opening and were joined by another set of tracks, larger than the ones we had followed. "A troll hole for sure!" Gorin said as he pointed his chin in the direction of the cave. "Now what laddie? How do we get them to attack the tower?"

"Leave that to me" smiled Galamdir. "Set up camp just over there, at the edge of the clearing. When night falls the trolls will awaken to a tempting meal - us! I'll get the to follow us as we run to the tower."

### Chased by Trolls

We set up a small camp and started a fire. I was able to catch a brace of conies and we had them roasting on the fire as darkness fell. We soon heard low voices and the pounding of heavy feet coming from the cave. "What is that lovely smell? Someone cookin' us dinner?". And out they came!

There were two trolls, one of them was the largest troll I had ever seen, a full head taller than the other. "Looky there" the big one said. "It is dinner!"

"Ooooh, I want the elf girl she looks tender!" With that Galamdir screamed like a small girl who had just seen a giant spider. 

"Don't let them eat me! Ooooooh!" She nodded towards the path back to the tower. "Run! I'm scared." Then quietly she said to me "Shoot at them, but make sure you miss! Go ahead, make them angry". I took my bow and shot arrow that landed at their feet.

"Now, now don't get feisty. All we wants is the girl, and may be the dwarf for dessert!" and they began chasing us.

And so it went on and on as we led them towards the tower. Galamdir would scream like a frightened child, I would fire an arrow at the ground and they would growl and hurl insults at us, all the while getting closer to the tower.

As we approached the secreted path leading to the tower, Galamdir told us to break into the trees before the guards saw us. She would stay on the path until the last minute. I started to object but the look she shot my way made the words stick in my mouth. There was no time to argue. Goring and I fled into the trees and Galamdir chose that moment to scream loudly, crying "Help, help." and catching the attention of the guards. She broke into the clearing just before the two massive trolls.

The guards attention was now on the hulking forms emerging from the trees and they fired a few arrows at this new foe. In the confusion, Galamdir seemed to disappear as she made her way to where we were waiting and watching. "That was fun!" she said with a smile.

### Trolls Battle and Galamdir Sneaks

The smaller of the trolls grabbed a rock and hurled it a a group of archers, taking two of them down. One of the guards shouted into the tower, "Trolls! Get out here, we need help." Quickly the clearing was filled with several more of the Shadowwing and the battle began in earnest. 

Over the din we heard a loud voice shout "How did they find the path? They shouldn't have been able to find the path!" They must have known or thought that the trolls were too dull-witted to find the hidden path to the tower. It was no secret any longer.

Galamdir ran towards the rear of the tower, "Quickly! To the breach in the wall while they are distracted!" We all hurried to the broken stone wall and hid ourselves behind a crop of boulders. "Stay here, I will sneak inside and retrieve the scrolls."

"What? No, you're not going in there alone" I whispered.

"I can move quieter without the two of you and your big feet. Don't worry, if I get in trouble I'll call for you."

"Wait!" called Gorin. "Take me horn with you. If ye need us, give it a blow and we'll come a'runnin'" 

Galamdir slid through the broken wall and disappeared into the tower. She moved silently into the tower and up the staircase toward the room where we glimpsed the fire. Rounding the corner at the top of the stairs, she saw one of the Shadowwing peering through an arrow slit at the chaos in the clearing.

She drew her knife and noiselessly approached the man from the rear. With the speed and grace of a viper, she put her hand over his mouth and slit his throat from ear to ear. He went down in a heap. Now she searched the room for the Chronicles. She was right. This room held many treasures and it took a few minutes for her to locate the Chronicles.

Several of the men had been crushed by rocks and trees thrown by the trolls, but the smaller trolls was mortally wounded by large man with a spear. This enraged the remaining troll but a concerted onslaught by the surviving Shadowwing members  caused him to give ground and retreat into the darkness.

"I've got it!" Galamdir whispered as she exited through the break in the wall. "Let's get out of here before they find the body." We made our way as quickly as we could to where we had left the horses. Luckily they were still there and were not ingredients in some troll's stew this evening. We headed towards the East road and road all night away from the Trollshaws, towards Bree.

### A Shadow on the Road

As the first rays of daylight streamed over the dew-covered trees, we were met by a lone figure blocking the road ahead. He was standing in the middle of the road, his face and garb obscured by the shadow of the trees. "Prepare yourselves" Gorin said with narrowed eyes. "This could be a trap!"

"A trap you say! Is that anyway to greet a friend?" called the shadow-cloaked traveler in the road. Just then the sun rose above the canopy and revealed the wizened face of Gandalf the wizard. 

"Mind if I join you on the way to Bree? I've asked one of the rangers from Annuminas to meet us there. He'll be glad to see you've found the Chronicles. Oh, I know you would succeed in your task so I took the liberty of summoning him as soon as you left the Prancing Pony." And so we enjoyed Gandalf's company as we traveled back to Bree and delivered the Chronicles of Annuminas to their guardian.

### Recap
Our company had a short rest in Bree after returning with the Chronicles of Annuminas. Gandalf met with us a week after we returned and ask that we deliver something to Halbarad, a leader of the Rangers. He was to be found near the Stoor Pool in the Angle.

We left Bree on the morning of the 20th of November. The air was crisp and sun shone brightly on the road ahead of us. We passed a few travelers heading towards Bree. Some were bringing their wares or produce to market. 

As the we traversed the Great East Road, moving quietly beneath the watchful shadow of Weathertop to the north, we stumbled upon a sight of serene beauty that beckoned a respite from their travels. There, nestled in a gentle curve of the road, lay the ruins of an ancient watchtower, its stones covered in a blanket of vibrant moss and climbing ivy. The sun dipped low, casting amber and crimson hues across the scene, while a crystal-clear stream wound its way past the fallen structure, singing a melodious tune that resonated with the tranquility of the ages. The water caught the dying light, creating a mosaic of sparkling jewels that seemed to dance upon the surface, inviting the weary travelers to pause and marvel at the wonders of a bygone era, momentarily forgetting the weight of their daunting quest.

As we moved south of Carlson's farm we noticed a great stag on the side of the road. He watched us from a distance and moved into a narrow gap in the hills. We followed, hoping to gain provisions for our journey. When we came out of the gap, the stag was nowhere to be found but we had progressed much further down the road than we think we should have. Was this an omen of good forutne?

Now we left the road and proceeded into hills bordering The Angle. As the we ascended the rolling hills, venturing into the land known as the Angle, we were greeted by the enchanting sight of the Last Bridge arching gracefully over the rushing waters of the river Mitheithel. But it was the glade they discovered just beyond, shrouded in an ethereal mist, that truly stole our breaths. Ancient, gnarled trees formed a protective canopy, their branches woven together in an intricate lattice that filtered the sunlight into a kaleidoscope of colors. The air was heavy with the scent of wildflowers, and the soft hum of bees lent a tranquility to the air. In the center of the glade, a clear pool reflected the sky above, so perfectly still that it appeared as a gateway to another world, a hidden jewel cradled in the embrace of the land. We lingered there, basking in the serenity of the glade, our hearts lightened and our spirits buoyed by the unexpected beauty found within the folds of the hills.

## The Stoor Pool
On the 28th of November we reached the quiet solitude of the Stoor Pool. We were tired from our journey and the prospect of resting in a secure ranger camp was welcome. As we gazed out over the tranquil waters, a voice called out from the wooded glen behind us. "I suspect your are Ereborn and company, or are you thieves out to steal my meager provisions?"

"And you must be Halbarad," I answered, "Or are you an Orc in disguise? Mae govannen, mellon nín." 

"Tolo dan naeth lín." replied Halbarad. This was a Ranger greeting used to identify other Rangers. In the western language it is "Well met, my friend. Come, sit by my fire."

"You have something for me from the Grey Pilgrim I believe." and he held out is hands. I placed the sealed note in his outstretched hands. Halbarad noted the seal and gently opened the parcel. He stood for a moment then turned away as he read it. "This is ill news, Ereborn. Yes, Gandalf told me your names. It seems Orcs are moving into the South Downs. That is not good, not good."

"The downs are close to the Shire and Bree." sighed Galamdir. "This is not good news indeed. What is to be done? Can you muster enough men to meet them in battle?"

"Not from here alone, but Gilraen has other forces that might be called to help. You are traveling to Rivendell, are you not?" I nodded. "Then tell the Fair Lady that I am prepared to meet the Orcs but need assistance. Our numbers are too few of late. But stay with us here tonight. You will be safe here and can rest well."

And so we stayed with Halbarad that evening and exchanged tales of those things we had seen and heard in these past few weeks. We rose fully rested and prepared to be off to Rivendell.

### Recap
Our company had a short rest in Bree after returning with the Chronicles of Annuminas. Gandalf met with us a week after we returned and ask that we deliver something to Halbarad, a leader of the Rangers. He was to be found near the Stoor Pool in the Angle.

We left Bree on the morning of the 20th of November. The air was crisp and the sun shone brightly on the road ahead of us. We passed a few travelers heading towards Bree. Some were bringing their wares or produce to market, their rickety carts creaking along the road. 

As the we traversed the Great East Road, moving quietly beneath the watchful shadow of Weathertop to the north, we stumbled upon a sight of serene beauty that beckoned a respite from our travels. There, nestled in a gentle curve of the road, lay the ruins of the ancient watchtower, its stones covered in a blanket of vibrant moss and climbing ivy. The sun dipped low, casting amber and crimson hues across the scene, while a crystal-clear stream wound its way past the fallen structure, singing a melodious tune that resonated with the tranquility of the ages. The water caught the dying light, creating a mosaic of sparkling jewels that seemed to dance upon the surface, inviting us weary travelers to pause and marvel at the wonders of a bygone era, momentarily forgetting the weight of their daunting quest.

As we moved south of Carlson's farm we noticed a great stag on the side of the road. He watched us from a distance and moved into a narrow gap in the hills. We followed, hoping to gain provisions for our journey. When we came out of the gap, the stag was nowhere to be found but we had progressed much further down the road than we should have. Was this an omen of good fortune?

Now we left the road and proceeded south into the hills that bordered The Angle. As we ascended the rolling hills, venturing into the land known as the Angle, we were greeted by the enchanting sight of the Last Bridge arching gracefully over the rushing waters of the river Mitheithel. But it was the glade we discovered just beyond, shrouded in an ethereal mist, that truly stole our breaths. Ancient, gnarled trees formed a protective canopy, their branches woven together in an intricate lattice that filtered the sunlight into a kaleidoscope of colors. The air was heavy with the scent of wildflowers, and the soft hum of bees lent a tranquility to the air. In the center of the glade, a clear pool reflected the sky above, so perfectly still that it appeared as a gateway to another world, a hidden jewel cradled in the embrace of the land. We lingered there, basking in the serenity of the glade, our hearts lightened and our spirits buoyed by the unexpected beauty found within the folds of the hills.

## The Stoor Pool
On the 28th of November we reached the quiet solitude of the still and silent Stoor Pool. We were tired from our journey and the prospect of resting in a secure ranger camp was welcome. As we gazed out over the tranquil waters, a voice called out from the wooded glen behind us. "I suspect your are Ereborn and company, or are you thieves out to steal my meager provisions?"

"And you must be Halbarad," I answered, "Or are you an Orc in disguise? Mae govannen, mellon nín." 

"Tolo dan naeth lín." replied Halbarad. This was a Ranger greeting used to identify other Rangers. In the western language it is "Well met, my friend. Come, sit by my fire."

"You have something for me from the Grey Pilgrim I believe." and he held out is hand. I placed the sealed note in his outstretched hand. Halbarad noted the seal and gently opened the parcel. He stood for a moment then turned away as he read it. "This is ill news, Ereborn. Yes, Gandalf told me your names. It seems Orcs are moving into the South Downs. That is not good, not good."

"The downs are close to the Shire and Bree." sighed Amdiriel. "This is not good news indeed. What is to be done? Can you muster enough men to meet them in battle?"

"Not from here alone, but Gilraen has other forces that might be called to help. You are traveling to Rivendell, are you not?" I nodded. "Then tell the Fair Lady that I am prepared to meet the Orcs but need assistance. Our numbers are too few of late. But stay with us here tonight. You will be safe here and can rest well."

And so we stayed with Halbarad that evening and exchanged tales of those things we had seen and heard in these past few weeks. We rose fully rested and prepared to be off to Rivendell.

-----------------
## Wargs!
"What's that?" Gorin said excitedly. "There be some excitement in the camp." 

Just then Halbarad threw open the tent flaps. "Get up quickly! We may need your swords. Wargs have been sighted. The larger group is approaching from the west but scouts also saw a few north of here. We'll meet the western group with cold steel but I would ask you to defend the camp from any coming out of the north."

"Of course, Halbarad. My sword is yours." I answered. 

"And my bow." added Amdiriel.

"And my axe!" shouted Gorin. "Let those overgrown mutts just try to get past me axe! They'll not get past us!"

And then the battle was on. Halbarad and his men ran westward over the hill. It was not long before we heard the sounds of battle wafting trhough the trees. Amdiriel looked at me with haste in her eyes, "We should seek defensive positions, Ereborn." She was right, we had delayed too long already.

She took up a position atop a large stack of crates. I found some smaller crates and prepared to fire my bow from their protection while Gorin stood anxiously by my side. "I hope some get through! I don't want them Rangers to have all the fun!" As if on queue the first warg approached the camp. It was large, much larger than the wolves we encountered earlier in the summer. Then a second and a third, the last to arrive was even larger than his brothers. His eyes seemed to glow with red fire. His dripping fangs were long and sharp.

Before the wargs could locate us, Amdiriel loosed an arrow into the biggest of them, who growled in defiance as her arrow struck him in the side. Now alert, the other two sought the source of their foe and seeing Amdiriel atop the crates, they charged, followed by their leader.

But Gorin stood in their way like a red-topped rock. Letting the first two pass by, his axe swung mightily at the large warg. With a great battle cry, his axe found purchase and the great monster let out a painful yelp. The other two were on me in seconds.

I managed to hit one of the attacking wargs and Amdiriel set an arrow flying into his hide as well, but he did not go down. His companion lunged at me and his fangs bit down on my arm. The warg leader's eyes glowed with hate for his red-bearded enemy and he bit down hard on Gorin's leg. But Gorin firmly stood his ground.

The injured warg joined in the fight against Gorin, but Gorin's axe struck again and the fire went out of those red eyes. My sword struck my remaining foe squarely in the neck and he went down without a sound. "There are more running in from the woods!" shouted Amdiriel.

Gorin's axe took out one of the newcomers with a single blow and I landed a good blow on another, but it kept coming. An arrow from Amdiriel stopped him in his tracks. My remaining foe managed to get inside my sword arm by feinting left, and I felt his jaw clamp down hard on my thigh, drawing blood.

Amdiriel called out once again. Another monster appeared on the edge of camp, blood dripping from his jaws. This one was even larger than his the giant we had already slain. Red eyes sought his prey and he charged Gorin. The great beast leapt at Gorin and his axe met it in mid-air, slicing a deep gash in it's side. Whoosh! An arrow pierced it's heart and it fell at Gorin's feet. Amdiriel smiled and nodded to the dwarf.

I retreated a few steps and as my opponent, thinking I was mortally wounded, charged recklessly only to find the waiting point of my sword. One more warg down and one left, which was intent on feasting on dwarf. It darted beneath the blow of his great axe and bit down on his thigh, but Gorin did not waiver. His axe came down one more time, severing the beast's head.

I looked around, waiting for more wargs to rush the camp. "Amdiriel, what do your elf eyes see from up there?"

"Nothing. I see no more wargs for now. You are injured. I should take a look at that."

"No not now. Stay there and keep watch." After several minutes she called out saying she could see Halbarad's men returning to camp.

"Look at the size of those beasts!" Halbarad gasped. "I've never seen wargs so huge. It looks like you put up a good fight and took some blows in return for your effort."

"Yes, it was quite a fight. They kept coming at us, but in the end we overcame." I breathed wearily.

"Aw laddie, it ne'er was in doubt. We coulda taken twice their number!" boasted Gorin. But I knew even he was alarmed when that monster showed up at the last.

Halbarad looked me over. "You should tend to your wounds and rest up. You can leave tomorrow. Right now, you need to rest. We'll talk again after I tend to the lads. We lost a few in that fight. How did they find us? Or even know we were here?" 

------------------
Amdiriel carefully and skillfully tended my wounds. Even with the pain burning in my thigh, I slept like an infant that night. I was glad that we would rest another day before traveling to Rivendell. If we found ourselves in another fight, I would not be much help with my leg so bound. Though I slept well and in peace, Amdiriel and Gorin woke with a new heaviness about them. I understood, it sometimes felt like the enemy was a weight around my neck and with the events of yesterday, I understood how they felt.

> Everyone gains 2 shadow points (dread). Gorin and Amdiriel fail their Shadow Tests. Ereborn succeeds with one Tengwar, removing both new shadow points.

## A Few Days Rest
The next morning I awoke well after first light. Gorin and Amdiriel had already left their beds and I heard the hearty sounds of the camp as they broke their fast. "Hello. Why did you not wake me? We should be on our way." I said as I limped over to the fire.

"Laddie, we can wait a day or two more while you gain a bit o' strength in that leg o' yours. Halbarad sent runners to Gilraen telling her to expect us soon." With that Gorin took a long swig from his mug and let out an enormous belched to which the rangers responded in hearty laughter.

Halbarad walked over to the fire and warned his hands. "I have been thinking, Ereborn. Do you think the wargs have been tracking you?"

"I, I don't know. I suppose it is possible but we saw no sign of it." And then to Gorin and Amdiriel, "Ah, I hate being idle like this, but I suppose you two are right. We'll leave in a few days. Now, what's for breakfast?"

So we stayed with the Rangers a few more days while my leg healed. We discussed the battle and exchanged more of the things we had learned in our travels. At last the day came to leave and we bid our farewells to our new-found friends. "You are always welcome by our fire" called Halbarad as we mounted our horses and set out on our way to see Gilraen.

### Recap
Our company had a short rest in Bree after returning with the Chronicles of Annuminas. Gandalf met with us a week after we returned and ask that we deliver something to Halbarad, a leader of the Rangers. He was to be found near the Stoor Pool in the Angle.

We left Bree on the morning of the 20th of November. The air was crisp and sun shone brightly on the road ahead of us. We passed a few travelers heading towards Bree. Some were bringing their wares or produce to market. 

As the we traversed the Great East Road, moving quietly beneath the watchful shadow of Weathertop to the north, we stumbled upon a sight of serene beauty that beckoned a respite from their travels. There, nestled in a gentle curve of the road, lay the ruins of an ancient watchtower, its stones covered in a blanket of vibrant moss and climbing ivy. The sun dipped low, casting amber and crimson hues across the scene, while a crystal-clear stream wound its way past the fallen structure, singing a melodious tune that resonated with the tranquility of the ages. The water caught the dying light, creating a mosaic of sparkling jewels that seemed to dance upon the surface, inviting the weary travelers to pause and marvel at the wonders of a bygone era, momentarily forgetting the weight of their daunting quest.

As we moved south of Carlson's farm we noticed a great stag on the side of the road. He watched us from a distance and moved into a narrow gap in the hills. We followed, hoping to gain provisions for our journey. When we came out of the gap, the stag was nowhere to be found but we had progressed much further down the road than we think we should have. Was this an omen of good forutne?

Now we left the road and proceeded into hills bordering The Angle. As the we ascended the rolling hills, venturing into the land known as the Angle, we were greeted by the enchanting sight of the Last Bridge arching gracefully over the rushing waters of the river Mitheithel. But it was the glade they discovered just beyond, shrouded in an ethereal mist, that truly stole our breaths. Ancient, gnarled trees formed a protective canopy, their branches woven together in an intricate lattice that filtered the sunlight into a kaleidoscope of colors. The air was heavy with the scent of wildflowers, and the soft hum of bees lent a tranquility to the air. In the center of the glade, a clear pool reflected the sky above, so perfectly still that it appeared as a gateway to another world, a hidden jewel cradled in the embrace of the land. We lingered there, basking in the serenity of the glade, our hearts lightened and our spirits buoyed by the unexpected beauty found within the folds of the hills.

## The Stoor Pool
On the 28th of November we reached the quiet solitude of the Stoor Pool. We were tired from our journey and the prospect of resting in a secure ranger camp was welcome. As we gazed out over the tranquil waters, a voice called out from the wooded glen behind us. "I suspect your are Ereborn and company, or are you thieves out to steal my meager provisions?"

"And you must be Halbarad," I answered, "Or are you an Orc in disguise? Mae govannen, mellon nín." 

"Tolo dan naeth lín." replied Halbarad. This was a Ranger greeting used to identify other Rangers. In the western language it is "Well met, my friend. Come, sit by my fire."

"You have something for me from the Grey Pilgrim I believe." and he held out is hands. I placed the sealed note in his outstretched hands. Halbarad noted the seal and gently opened the parcel. He stood for a moment then turned away as he read it. "This is ill news, Ereborn. Yes, Gandalf told me your names. It seems Orcs are moving into the South Downs. That is not good, not good."

"The downs are close to the Shire and Bree." sighed Galamdir. "This is not good news indeed. What is to be done? Can you muster enough men to meet them in battle?"

"Not from here alone, but Gilraen has other forces that might be called to help. You are traveling to Rivendell, are you not?" I nodded. "Then tell the Fair Lady that I am prepared to meet the Orcs but need assistance. Our numbers are too few of late. But stay with us here tonight. You will be safe here and can rest well."

And so we stayed with Halbarad that evening and exchanged tales of those things we had seen and heard in these past few weeks. We rose fully rested and prepared to be off to Rivendell.

## Wargs!
"What's that?" Gorin said excitedly. "There be some excitement in the camp." 

Just then Halbarad threw open the tent flaps. "Get up quickly! We may need your swords. Wargs have been sighted. The larger group is approaching from the west but scouts also saw a few north of here. We'll meet the western group with cold steel but I would ask you to defend the camp from any coming out of the north."

"Of course, Halbarad. My sword is yours." I answered. 

"And my bow." added Galamdir.

"And my axe!" shouted Gorin. "Let those overgrown mutts just try to get past me axe! They'll not get past us!"

And then the battle was on. Halbarad and his men ran westward over the hill. It was not long before we heard the sounds of battle wafting trhough the trees. Galamdir looked at me with haste in her eyes, "We should seek defensive positions, Ereborn." She was right, we had delayed too long already.

She took up a position atop a large stack of crates. I found some smaller crates and prepared to fire my bow from their protection while Gorin stood anxiously by my side. "I hope some get through! I don't want them Rangers to have all the fun!" As if on queue the first warg approached the camp. It was large, much larger than the wolves we encountered earlier in the summer. Then a second and a third, the last to arrive was even larger than his brothers. His eyes seemed to glow with red fire. His fangs were long and sharp.

Before they could locate us, Galamdir loosed an arrow into the big warg, who growled in defiance as struck him in the side. Now alert the other two sought the source of their foe and seeing Galamdir atop the crates, they charged, followed by their leader.

But Gorin stood in their way like a red-topped rock. Letting the first two pass by, his axe swung mightily at the large warg. With a great battle cry, his axe found purchase and the great monster let out a painful yelp. The other two were on me in seconds.

I managed to hit one of the wargs attacking me and Galamdir set an arrow flying into his hide as well, but he did not go down. His companion lunged at me and his fangs bit down on my arm. The warg leader's eyes glowed with hate for his red-bearded enemy and he bit down hard on Gorin's leg. But Gorin firmly stood his ground.

The injured warg joined in the fight against Gorin, but Gorin's axe struck again and the fire went out of those red eyes. My sword struck my remaining foe squarely in the neck and he went down without a sound. "There are more running in from the woods!" shouted Galamdir.

Gorin's axe took out one of the newcomers with a single blow and I landed a good blow on another, but it kept coming. An arrow from Galamdir stopped him in his tracks. My remaining foe managed to get inside my sword arm by feinting left, and I felt his jaw clamp down hard on my thigh, drawing blood.

Galamdir called out once again. Another monster appeared on the edge of camp, blood dripping from his jaws. This one was even larger than his brother. Red eyes sought his prey and he charged Gorin. The great beast leapt at Gorin and his axe met it in mid-air, slicing a deep gash in it's side. Whoosh! An arrow pierced it's heart and it fell at Gorin's feet. Galamdir smiled and nodded to the dwarf.

I retreated a few steps and as my opponent thinking I was mortally wounded, charged recklessly only to find the point of my sward waiting. One more warg down and one was left, intent on feasting on dwarf. It darted beneath the blow of his great axe and bit down on his thigh, but Gorin did not waiver. His axe came down one more time, severing the beast's head.

I looked around, waiting for more wargs to rush the camp. "Galamdir, what do your elf eyes see from up there?"

"Nothing. I see no more wargs for now. You are injured. I should take a look at that."

"No not now. Stay there and keep watch." After several minutes she called out saying she could see Halbarad's men returning to camp.

"Look at the size of those beasts!" Halbarad gasped. "I've never seen ones so huge. It looks like you put up a good fight and took some blows in return for your effort."

"Yes, it was quite a fight. They kept coming at us, but in the end we overcame." I breathed wearily.

"Aw laddie, it ne'er was in doubt. We coulda taken twice their number!" boasted Gorin. But I knew even he was alarmed when that monster showed up at the last.

Halbarad looked me over. "You should tend to your wounds and rest up. You can leave tomorrow. Right now, you need to rest. We'll talk again after I tend to the lads. We lost a few in that fight. How did they find us? Or even know we were here?" 

------------------
Galamdir carefully and skillfully tended my wounds. Even with the pain burning in my thigh, I slept like an infant that night. I was glad that we took another day before traveling to Rivendell. If we found ourselves in another fight, I would not be much help. Though I slept well, Galamdir and Gorin woke with a new heaviness about them. I understood, it sometimes felt like the enemy was a weight around your neck and with the events of yesterday, I understood how they felt.

> Everyone gains 2 shadow points (dread). Gorin and Galamdir fail their Shadow Tests. Ereborn succeeds with one Tengwar, removing both new shadow points.

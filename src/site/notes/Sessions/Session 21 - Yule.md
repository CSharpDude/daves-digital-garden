<< [[Sessions/Session 20 - Return to Rivendell\|Session 20 - Return to Rivendell]] | [[]] >>
## Recap
Our company left the Stoor Pool and made our way to Rivendell. We arrived on December 11 and were greeted by Faereil, who led us to Gilraen. We dined together in the gardens, where Gilraen thanked us for our help and informed us that she would send aid to Halbarad. As a reward, she gave our company 18 treasure.
## Log

Gorin chose to go home for Yule while Amdiriel took Gilraen's offer to winter in Rivendell. I chose to return to Halbarad's company. They were planning to winter near Bree and I wished to speak again with Mithrandir.

## Gorin Goes Home
Gorin left Rivendell and made his way to Erebor. While there he overheard a rumor about a great dragon hoard in the far north, the hoard of Viglund. 

## Amdiriel Meets with Gilraen
"Gilraen, I have a favor to ask of you. I do not wish to presume upon your hospitality, but you must know something of my sister, Galamdir."

"Yes. I am sorry for your loss." Gilraen's visage was fair as ever but tinged with sadness.

"I wish to know where Orthog the Dark escaped to and what he may be planning. If fate allows I would avenge my sister's death. Please tell me what you know of this horrid creature."

"I regret to bear dark tidings, Amdiriel, but your quest must endure beyond the grief you have already borne. Orthog the Dark, a shadow that once crept upon our lands, has eluded final justice by the virtue of his foul cunning and the swiftness of his retreat. After the cruel clash that took Galamdir from us, he vanished into the depths of the Misty Mountains, where rumor tells he marshals a new horde in the caverns' cold embrace.

They say he forges plans of malice, driven by a hunger for revenge against those who have thwarted his savage ambitions before. It is feared that Orthog's thirst for power grows with the passing of each moon, harvesting wrath from the grim echoes of his lair. Even now, his name is whispered with dread among the scattered folk of the frontier – a harbinger of fresh woe yet to be visited upon the innocent.

Rest assured, your sister's memory burns bright in the hearts of the Dúnedain, as does the flame of resolve to see an end to Orthog's dark deeds. I vow to you, by the silent stars above, that vigilance shall be kept; his shadow shall not creep forth unchallenged, nor shall his evil spread unchecked across these lands. Would that I may bring you solace in the knowledge that your quest for vengeance is shared, and the pursuit of this foe is relentless." Gilraen sighed and placed her slender hand on Amdiriel's shoulder."

"Thank you my Lady. I am comforted with the knowledge of the Dúnedain's vigilance" Amdiriel nodded.

"One more thing my child. You must tell your friends about this, about your quest for vengeance. They deserve to know  what burns in your heart and they would desire to help you if they can. I have told you what I know, now do this for me."

"I, I will. They have been good friends. Thank you again for your wisdom." Amdiriel bowed and left to return to her quarters.

Later that winter, Amdiriel heard a rumor about an Orc raiding party traveling through the Weather Hills. Could this be him, the one how had slain Galamdir?

## Ereborn Meets With Gandalf in Bree
Gandalf met Ereborn in the Prancing Pony. He wanted to know more about Shadow-bane and thought that Gandalf may be able to help.

"Let me see your sword. Hmm" he muttered as he carefully studied the weapon. Gandalf closed his eyes and spoke words in a language Ereborn did not understand as he ran his fingers gently along the blade. A faint blue light ran from his fingertips to the gleaming steel blade. Looking up the wizard whispered "You already know this blade is magically keen and that certain evil men and undead are especially prone to it's edge. But there is something deeper, older. When a foe is slain, your speed is enhanced so that you can attack another foe before he can attack you."

Ereborn discovers the sword [[Items/Shadow-Bane\|Shadow-Bane]] has the Cleaving reward.

## Together Again
As winter waned and the singing of birds and buds on the trees in Rivendell's garden hinted at springtime, the fellowship of I Faronyd gathered together once more. They discussed what they had learned in their recent travels and told stories of their homelands. Amdiriel told all that she had learned studying late winter's nights in Elrond's library.

Amdiriel also shared with her friends the story of her sister Galamdir and the ruthless Orc leader, Orthog the Dark that cruelly struck her down. They three vowed together that if the opportunity arose, they would find this Orthog and slay him to avenge Amdriel's sister. When her friends made this vow, Amdiriel felt a new peace in her heart and was moved to tears by the compassion of her friends. 

## Council With Gilraen
Once the companions had reassembled in Rivendell, they requested an audience with Gilraen on Amdriel's behalf. The story of her sister's demise at the hands of the vile Orthog the Dark affected them deeply and they wanted to avenge her death. 

### Council with Gilraen and Elrond
Resistance : 3

#### Introduction
Amdiriel greeted Lady Gilraen and Lord Elrond. "Lord Elrond and Lady Gilraen, I thank you for agreeing to meet with us. Your patronage Lady Gilraen has been most welcome to our company and we are blessed to be in your service. You have provided us with many opportunities to do what we most desire  - to oppose the Shadow as it descends upon our fair land. I trust that our service has proved useful in your fight against the schemes of the Enemy." 

> Length 3

"Your service has indeed proved useful and s greatly appreciated, but I sense there is more to this meeting than usual. What is it that you desire, Amdiriel?" Gilraen asked kindly and sincerely while [[Patrons/Elrond\|Elrond]] looked on quizzically.

#### Interaction
Amdirel, fixing her gaze on Gilraen said "I would ask of you a boon this day My Lady. You know of the fate of my sister, Galamdir. We spoke of this earlier in the winter's dark hours. I thank you for the news you brought concerning the Orc Orthog the Dark and for the vigilance of the Dúnedain to find this foul creature. He is a stain on the land of Middle Earth and a threat to the free people's of Eriador."

"The boon I..." then gracefully sweeping her arm towards Gorin and I she corrected, "We - would ask of you is your leave to find and destroy Orthog wherever he may hide this season."

Gilraen thought for a moment and looked at Elrond whose face remained unreadable. "This task you wish to undertake would prove dangerous indeed and before it is accomplished may require more assistance than my simply giving you leave to pursue it. I understand why you wish it and I am pleased to see you have found the support of your friends - they are to be commended for their devotion to you. My concern is that this may be *i fovren muda*, what men call a fool's errand. The opposition would be great and you, as accomplished as you are, are only three."

At this point Gorin cleared his throat and cautiously spoke. "Forgive my Lady, but we three are more than three alone. If I have learned anything this last year it is how three companions can be much more than is seen by eye. We have pulled ourselves through trials and dangerous battles not only because of our skill, but because we did it together."

"That may be true Master Dwarf, and I have not doubt of your skill and of the kinship of your company, but the danger and cunning of this enemy may be beyond even those advantages" spoke Elrond sternly to Gorin. "Carë mára quí tyarë naxa. (Doing good may cause evil)"

"I understand, and we have weighed the risk" Amdiriel politely responded. "We believe we can accomplish our goal, though we know not exactly how that might be. We are not ready to throw our lives away needlessly, but at times risks must be taken for the prospect of greater good. Should Orthog be unchecked many will pay with their lives." 

"Our purpose is to oppose the Shadow wherever we find it. I onlui nad an gwathren na gel na'an man núr úna ceri or in western speech - Shadow will triumph only if good people nothing. This is something we *can* do. Yes, it is dangerous. If we do not find a way to accomplish our goal with a reasonable chance of success, perhaps we can provide information you and the Rangers of the North can use to combat Orthog in whatever foul plans he is laying. This quest, while it is my personal wish, is also our duty to you and to this land."

#### Council Conclusion
"You appeal to my heart Amdiriel. You are indeed wise. Your company is fortunate to have such a scholar as you among them. I grant your request but with a request of my own. I will provide whatever news I can about Orthog to help you in your quest. In return I strongly ask that you do not take unwise chances. Your service is important to me - as you are Amdiriel Niniel." These were words of endearment spoken by Gilraen meaning "Amdiriel my daughter."

" I faer nîn linna nan glass hiril vuin Gilraen - I thank you from my heart Lady Gilraen!"

"Sílo Anor bo men lín - May the sun shine on your road. Before you go, give me a few days to inquire for the latest word from the Misty Mountains. Perhaps there is news of this creature's whereabouts. Come see me when the moon's waning bow is visible in the night sky."

> The council was successful. Gorin's attempt failed but Amdiriel's first attempt at insight was a great success with one ![tengwar-symbol-bg.png|inl|25](/img/user/zz_assetts/tengwar-symbol-bg.png). Her second roll on Enhearten was a success.

#### Together Again
Smiling Amdiriel looked to Gorin and then to me. "Thank you both for standing with me and for risking your lives for my quest. It will not be easy. We may not even be able to find this Orthog."

"Oh we'll be finding this scoundrel lassie, mark my words. And when we do, I'll crush his ugly skull with me axe! Mark my words!" Gorin said with the utmost confidence.

"We are with you in this Amdiriel. If we encounter foes we cannot possibly overcome then we can lead the Rangers to his lair. We will prevail one way or the other. But we have to find him first."

"Leave that to me laddie! And I think Gilraen has thoughts she has not yet shared. We'll find the beast, ne'er you fear." boasted Gorin.

And so our company once again readied ourselves for a long journey into unknown adventure and peril alike. Just the way we like it.

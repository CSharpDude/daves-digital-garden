### Recap


### Log

Gorin chose to go home for Yule while Amdiriel took Gilraen's offer to winter in Rivendell. I chose to return to Halbarad's company. They were planning to winter near Bree and I wished to speak again with Mithrandir.

## Gorin Goes Home
Gorin left Rivendell and made his way to Erebor. While there he overheard a rumor about a great dragon hoard in the far north, the hoard of Viglund.

## Amdiriel Meets with Gilraen
"Gilraen, I have a favor to ask of you. I do not wish to presume upon your hospitality, but you must know of my sister, Galamdir."

"Yes. I am sorry for your loss." Gilraen's visage was fair as ever but tinged with sadness.

"I wish to know where Orthog the Dark escaped to and what he may be planning. If fate allows I would avenge my sister's death. Please tell me what you know of this creature."

"I regret to bear dark tidings, Amdiriel, but your quest must endure beyond the grief you have already borne. Orthog the Dark, a shadow that once crept upon our lands, has eluded final justice by the virtue of his foul cunning and the swiftness of his retreat. After the cruel clash that took Galamdir from us, he vanished into the depths of the Misty Mountains, where rumor tells he marshals a new horde in the caverns' cold embrace.

They say he forges plans of malice, driven by a hunger for revenge against those who have thwarted his savage ambitions before. It is feared that Orthog's thirst for power grows with the passing of each moon, harvesting wrath from the grim echoes of his lair. Even now, his name is whispered with dread among the scattered folk of the frontier – a harbinger of fresh woe yet to be visited upon the innocent.

Rest assured, your sister's memory burns bright in the hearts of the Dúnedain, as does the flame of resolve to see an end to Orthog's dark deeds. I vow to you, by the silent stars above, that vigilance shall be kept; his shadow shall not creep forth unchallenged, nor shall his evil spread unchecked across these lands. Would that I may bring you solace in the knowledge that your quest for vengeance is shared, and the pursuit of this foe is relentless." Gilraen sighed and placed her slender hand on Amdiriel's shoulder."

"Thank you my Lady. I am comforted with the knowledge of the Dúnedain's vigilance" Amdiriel nodded.

"One more thing my child. You must tell your friends about this, your quest for vengeance. They deserve to know and would desire to help you if they can. I have told you what I know, now do this for me."

"I, I will. They are good friends. Thank you again for your wisdom." Amdiriel bowed and left to return to her quarters.

Later that winter, Amdiriel heard a rumor about an Orc raiding party traveling through the Weather Hills. Could this be him?

## Ereborn Meets With Gandalf in Bree
Gandalf met Ereborn in the Prancing Pony. He wanted to know more about Shadow-bane and thought that Gandalf may be able to help.

"Let me see your sword. Hmm" he said as he carefully studied the weapon. Gandalf closed his eyes and muttered words in a language Ereborn did not understand as he ran his fingers gently along the blade. A faint blue light ran from his fingertips to the steel blade. "You already know this blade is magically keen and that certain evil men and undead are especially prone to it's edge. But there is something deeper, older. When a foe is slain, your speed is enhanced so that you can attack another foe before he can attack you."

Ereborn discovers the sword has the Cleaving attribute.

## Together Again
As winter waned and spring was hinted at by the singing of birds and buds on the trees in Rivendell's garden, I Faronyd gathered together once more. They discussed what they had learned and told stories of their homelands. Amdiriel told what she had learned studying in Elrond's library.

Amdiriel also shared with her friends the story of her sister Galamdir and the ruthless Orc leader, Orthog the Dark that killed her. They vowed together that if the opportunity arose they would find this Orthog and slay him to avenge her sister. When they made this vow, Amdiriel felt a peace and was moved to tears by the compassion of her friends.

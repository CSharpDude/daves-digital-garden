### Recap
In Session 4 of the Fellowship's journey in Middle-earth, they returned to Rivendell after their encounter with orcs at Rhudaur's Eye. They informed Gilraen the Fair about the events and the potential threat of a larger force. Gilraen examined a magical sword they had found and warned them of its power and potential dangers. The Fellowship enjoyed the hospitality of the Elves in Rivendell, and Gorin recovered from his injuries. They also had a brief encounter with Arwen Und√≥miel, which left them in awe. The next day, Gilraen called them to discuss a powerful servant of the enemy seen near Bree, and she tasked the Fellowship with investigating and foiling their plans. They prepared for their journey and set off on August 21.

### Log

We set off early in the morning of August 21. A mist covered the ground making the sight of Rivendell even more ethereal as we left it behind us. It would be easier travelling this time with our sturdy horses. We decided to again make for Bree before venturing south into the Barrow downs. Someone must be able to provide a clue to the whereabouts of these strange goings on.

As we past south of the Trollshaws, the day turned gloomy but then suddenly the clouds parted as if blown away by the wings of a great beast and the sun shone brightly upon us. All gloomy spirits were brightened for the remainder of the day.

As we approached the Last Bridge, we saw that a storm had caused severe flooding of the road. It took the better part of the morning to find a way around and across the Hoarwell.

On the fifth day of our journey to Bree a lone wolf broke from the brush. It fled and did not attack but Belegroc was startled and threw me from the saddle. We found her quickly but the pack had split open and we spent several hours gathering up what had spilled into the road. Lose one day.

We did spend one night at the Ferrick farm. They were gracious to feed us and provide comfortable sleeping arrangements.

On August 29, late in the day we reached Bree and headed straight to the Prancing Pony for a hot meal and a bed.

The next morning we met in the common room to break our fast with a tasty meal of hen's eggs, salty bacon, and hot biscuits with honey butter. After our hearty meal, I approached Barnabas Butterbur, the proprietor and asked him about any strange folk he heard about the local area. 

"Aye. But what's that different from any of these days. Queer things afoot. Ain't that normal, at least in the Pony" he said with a laugh. "I did here some of the farmers and traders talk of strange lights o'er the downs at night. Ain't seen 'em myself cause I'm always here at night. There's a trader name of Tom Little that was talking about such things. He left for the Shire but should be back tonight. Mayhaps you can catch him."

Thanking Barnabas for the information, I went back to our table. Gorin and Galamdir were content to wait until night and see if the trader showed. we ordered another round of biscuits and listened to Gorin tell more of his stories of dwarven kingdoms and treasures.

We met again in the common room before nightfall. The room quickly filled with all sorts of folk from common to trader to Bree-hobbit and even an elf of two. It was hard to see who came and went, but Barnabas assured us he would tell us when the Tom came in. Raucous singing and laughter marked a table of three dwarfs who were celebrating, well I don't know because dwarfs seemed to celebrate everything with pints upon pints of ale! Gorin went over to talk with them when Baranabas tilted his head towards a slight man coming through the door.

He was alone and sought a place to sit. I motioned him toward our table. At first he hesitated and the with a shrug sat down opposite me. "Thank you kindly stranger. Millie!"

"I know, I know. Yer dinner is comin'." croaked the waitress.

Just as she delivered his food another man, a tall man with a short beard sat down across from Galmdril. "Tom, where's mine? I told you to get me dinner. Millie!" Millie shook her head and brought a plate to the newcomer.

"This here's Martin. He helps with the wagon team and other things. Never did catch your names and I must say, an elf maiden in these parts. Not a common sight. I'm Tom. Little."

We introduced ourselves and asked what he knew about anything strange going on around here. We did not mention Gilraen, the rangers or our quest. He looked up at me, momentarily forgetting his meal. "I've seen thing. What's it to you? You gonna laugh like other folk?"

I assured him we were really interested for reasons of our own and he settled back down to his plate. "I've heard tell of travelers to Bree who never stepped foot through the gate. They just disappeared. And sometimes at night from the Greenway I see strange lights far across them Barrow Downs. Not natural I say. Hear a kind of shrieking once too. Just that once. But others tell me they heered it too. Rumor has it that among those barrows a wight-king is gathering the dead to his service. That's what I heard."

"Aw Tom that's just women-folk tales." guffawed Martin. " No offense miss."

"I heared what I heared."

I asked if he could be more specific where he heard the sounds and saw the lights. He pointed to a spot on our map where the Greenway narrows between the Barrow Downs and South Downs. It was about a day's walk south of Bree. "You ain't plannin' to go out there, are you? If so you're a nutter to be sure. Leave the dead alone I say. Leave the dead alone."

Gorin returned with another mug of ale in hand laughing, telling tales of the the dwarve's travels. When the stories became a but bawdy, Galmdir frowned and Gorin sheepishly apologized and smiled. We went outside to talk quietly and plan our next move.

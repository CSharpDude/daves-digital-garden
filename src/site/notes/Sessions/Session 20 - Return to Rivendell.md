### Recap
Our company left Bree and embarked on a journey to find Halbarad, a leader of the Rangers. Along the way, we encountered serene landscapes and a majestic stag. Upon reaching the Stoor Pool, we delivered a message from Gandalf to Halbarad, who informed us of the presence of Orcs in the South Downs. We offered our assistance and defended the camp against a pack of wargs, emerging victorious. After tending to our wounds, we rested with the Rangers for a few days before continuing our journey to Rivendell.

## Leaving the Stoor Pool 
And so on December 5, we departed the Rangers, thanking them for their care. They in turn were grateful for our help defending against the wargs. We set out cross country roughly following the Loudwater as we made for the East Road. At one point we seemed to lose our way as a thick, damp fog descended from the east. Even Gorin was having difficulty choosing our path, but eventually his smiled saying "Ho, this way me friends! I'll not lose our way! Here is the Loudwater once again with her boiling, bubbling noise. Come on, come on. We're gettin' close to the road."

## Arrival at Rivendell
We crossed into Rivendell about noon on December 11 and were met by a member of Gilraen's house named Faereil. "Mae govannen. Please follow me. Gilraen will meet with you this evening. She is eager to hear you tales. Until then please rest and if you are hungry from your travels feel free to eat from the table."

Faereil left us in one of the halls in The Last Homely House where we waited until the evening. As the hour to meet with the Gilraen approached Gorin became fidgety and refused to stay still. "What's wrong with you Gorin? You act like you are waiting to undertake an unpleasant journey."

"Nothing. Nothings wrong with me! I'm just excited to s.. for the ale's all." he said with a twist of his hairy head. And then quietly so only I could hear he added, "Do ya think she'll be there? The Lady Arwen I mean." His ruddy cheeks blushed as he spoke and he looked aside to see if Amdiriel overheard his query.

"I don't know if Arwen will be dining with us" I said loud enough to ensure Amdiriel could hear clearly. "Why do you ask?"

"Ah laddie, why'd you have answer so loud that the elf could hear." he harrumphed and walked away towards the fire roaring in the hearth. 

The door opened to reveal Faereil. "Follow me please. Gilraen would like to dine in the gardens." We followed him and were again struck by the sylvan beauty of Rivendell. Never had I seen a place so wonderful a sight. There was a round table set for four under a stately elm tree overlooking a shimmering pond. Gilraen awaited us there.

"Come. Sit down. We will dine together and you can fill me in on your travels." She gracefully made a motion to us to join her. "Thank you, Faereil." He nodded and left us in the grove with the Lady Gilraen, Gilraen the Fair.

"Master dwarf, Gorin, it is good to see you again. The Lady Arwen could not be with us tonight. She sends her apologies." Gorin blushed and squirmed in his seat. If she noticed, Gilraen did not  show it. Looking at Amdiriel she spoke in Sindarin "Suilad, Amdiriel. Isto naetha le iest lin."

"Hiril Gilraen, hannon le" answered Amdiriel as she bowed her head to the Lady.

"And you Ereborn. Welcome back to Rivendell. Please now eat and we will talk." Gilraen smiled and placed some fruit on her plate. We followed her lead and enjoyed the elven fare as we exchanged pleasantries. 

Eventually Gilraen wanted to know about everything that had occurred since our surreptitious meeting at The Prancing Pony. She listened intently and thoughtfully to our stories. When I recounted Halbarad's news about orcs in the South Downs, she took particular notice. 

"Yes, I will send aid to Halbarad. This is most distressing." she sighed. "You have done a great service to me and the Rangers. Please take this as a reward for your efforts."

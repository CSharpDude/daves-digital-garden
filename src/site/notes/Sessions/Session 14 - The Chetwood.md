### Recap
In Session 13, the Fellowship returned to Bree after their battle with Drameth and the Wraiths. They were surprised to find Gilraen, who revealed that Gandalf the Grey was also present. Gandalf explained that the Chronicles of Ann√∫minas, ancient records of the North Kingdom, had been stolen and tasked the Fellowship with retrieving them. They learned that the culprits had evaded the Rangers and their tracks led towards the Misty Mountains and the south. Galamdir provided information about the Chetwood, a dense and mysterious forest east of Bree, where they would begin their search. The Fellowship spent the next fortnight strengthening their bonds and gathering rumors about the "Shadow Wanderers" in the Chetwood. They then met with Gandalf on the full moon, who officially assigned them the task of finding the stolen Chronicles.

### A Journey Begins
We left early the next morning for Chetwood with Gorin in the lead, looking for clues as to where the Ranger cache might be. We only had a general idea and it took most of the day to locate it. It had been disturbed as we thought it would. Tracks around the area where strange and inconsistent. Some lead north, some east, some south. Which to follow?

We decided to follow the southernly tracks as best as we could. We had just come from the north and no desire to travel there again quickly. South it was.

Just after we crossed the East Road and were entering the southern forest, the sound of talking and laughing carried on the wind. It seemed to be coming from just beyond the rise ahead of us. Slowly we crept forward and, to our surprise, we found a company of Hobbits sitting around a fire, talking singing and laughing.

"Ho there good Hobbits" I called. "We mean you no harm. We are rangers in search of a band of thieves. Have you seen anything suspicious in these woods?"

### A Raven in the Dark

The elder of the Hobbits stood and looked us over. "We may have. We have. A small group of cloaked men passed our camp yesterday. I don't think they saw us. They were dressed in black hooded cloaks and were moving eastward, but staying off of the road. They moved swiftly as if they were fleeing something or someone. Gave us the shivers. Something was not right with those men. 

Their cloaks were emblazoned with a raven surrounded by a circle of runes of some kind. Milo here is a pretty good artist, he is and he drew it out. From memory mind you. He really is very good, don't you think?" He handed us a small drawing.

"I didn't catch your name master hobbit. My name is Erebor. Might we keep this? It may prove helpful in finding them."

"Yes. Yes. You can have it. I'm called Rowan. Rowan Smallburrow."

"Thank you kindly Rowan... and Milo. We are grateful."

With that we bid the Hobbits good day. "So east it is that we must go."

"Let me see that." Galamdir looked carefully at the drawing. "This resembles the emblem of a group known as the [[Adversaries/Shadowwing Brotherhood\|Shadowwing Brotherhood]]. They are said to have the ability to move unseen and strike their foes from the shadows. They would not be above helping an agent of the enemy for a price. They are supposed to have a hidden enclave somewhere in the Trollshaws."

"The Trollshaws. Ack, I hate trolls." spat Gorin. "But it seems we're a-goin' that way laddie. Keep a torch handy. We should camp here for the night and strike out in the mornin'."

And so our path was taking us towards the Trollshaws.

### Recap
In Session 12 of the Opposing the Shadow campaign in Middle-earth, the Fellowship continued their search for Drameth. They discovered Blossum Mound, a hill where Halfling archers had fought bravely in a battle. Resting there, they then headed north to the Northern Slopes, where Nalien remembered seeing Drameth riding alongside Prince Ëarnur of Gondor. They encountered Drameth, who appeared both terrible and beautiful, and engaged in a fierce battle with her and the Wraiths. With their combined efforts, they managed to defeat Drameth, causing the remaining Wraiths to retreat. Nalien, now at peace, decided to sail to the Grey Havens and gifted the company with powerful items before bidding them farewell. The Fellowship then left the battlefield and made their way back to Bree.
### A Surprise Meeting
We reached Bree in the second week of October and, as was now our custom, headed to the Prancing Pony for refreshment and lodging. As we approached the bar, Barnabas, nodding towards a dark alcove in the rear of the room,  quietly told us "Someone's here what's looking for you. Mysterious woman sitting in the rear."

Glancing at each other, conveying unsaid caution to be ready for anything, we slowly made our way toward the dark alcove. As we approached the table, Gorin moved to the right and Galamdir to the left. We would not be taken by surprise. At the table was what appeared to be a woman dressed in a green hooded cloak, the cloak obscuring her face from view. It was as if her face had no memorable details.

"Suspicious, are we? Is this any way to greet your friend and patron?". Sliding her hood back slightly and just for a moment, we recognized none other than Gilraen! "Do not be so surprised. I do not always remain in Rivendell and I have good reason to be in Bree this night. My reason has in fact arrived just now."
### The Grey One
The Pony seemed to quiet itself from its usual raucous din as a lone figure entered and slowly made his way through the room. Tall and lean, he exuded an air of wisdom and power that seemed to emanate from deep within his being.

His attire was as distinctive as the man himself. He wore a long, flowing grey robe that billowed around him, adorned with intricate patterns and Sindarin symbols that hinted at his connection to the magical. A wide-brimmed hat, also grey, rested upon his head, casting a shadow that added to the air of mystery surrounding him.

His long, silver-grey hair cascaded down his shoulders, framing a face weathered by countless journeys and the weight of ages. His piercing blue eyes, filled with both kindness and a hint of mischief, seemed to hold the secrets of the world. They twinkled with a spark of ancient knowledge and a glimmer of the unknown. In his hand, he carried a staff, tall and gnarled, its surface etched with intricate runes and symbols. "A Wizard!" gasped Gorin, and then narrowing his eyes, "It ain't natural.

"Your late!" shot Gilraen with a hint of jest. 

After a moment's pause, the grey figure responded with "Nonsense. A wizard is never early or late but..."

"Always arrives when he intends to." Gilraen answered for him. Then they both laughed. I don't think I ever saw her laugh before. It was a wonderful sight and sound that brought both lightness and joy to those that heard it. "Please, sit. These three are the ones of whom I have told you."

![Gandalf.png|200](/img/user/zz_assetts/Gandalf.png)

"Hello. I am called [[Patrons/Gandalf\|Gandalf]], Gandalf the Grey." He nodded his head down and to the right. Then looking up again at Gilraen, "My Lady, have you been followed?"

"Mithrandir, I have ways to prevent even the Enemy from knowing my travels, at least for the present." Looking at us, she continued, "My friends, tell us both all that you have discovered on your journey to the North. Tells us of Nalien and the one she sought. Leave nothing out. Take what time you need. I have given word and dinner shall be brought shortly."

We began at the beginning when we last left Bree and explained how we encountered Nalien, the state she was in when we found her, paying special attention to her curious madness. We told them about the the orcs that pursued her, how we fought them, and of our injuries. I told of the cleverness of Galamdir that provided time for Gorin and I to heal. But we spent the most time describing our encounter with Drameth and the three Fell Wraiths.

"It is amazing that you are alive, much less victorious" mused the wizard. "You say when this Drameth passed from this life she seemed - relieved. Would you say she looked as if she had been freed from something?"

Galamdir answered, "Yes. Most definitely. It seemed as if she had been held prisoner and forced into the horrible visage we witnessed, but that it was not really her. It was not her true essence. Once freed by the Blade of Arahel, also called Mán-belthor, the wraith-slayer,  the real Drameth was once again free to be herself, if only for a moment. She seemed at peace."

"Do you see My Lady? It is as we have feared." Gandalf sighed. "Something or someone is able to exert power over the dead. Not for a long time, a very long time, has this kind of power come to Middle Earth."

"Mithrandir, others will resist this notion. You know of whom I speak." remarked Gilraen. "Still, we must push forward and gather as much knowledge as we are able. The very foundations of the world may depend on it. We cannot ask more of these three, not just yet."

"Yes. What they have managed to do is far more than should have been possible. They must be given a respite, at least a short one." Gandalf looked at us with compassion and kindness.

"My friends, I must return to Rivendell. Gandalf will have a task for you. Meet him here at the next full moon. When you are able, return to Rivendell." Gilraen looked at each of us in turn and invited us to spend Yule in Rivendell. "You may of course travel home if you prefer. Know that my invitation stands. I must take my leave. You are in capable hands."

She stood up and pulling her hooded cloak closely about her, she left the inn. Three cloaked figures I had not before seen stood as she passed and followed her into the night. The Elven magic of the cloaks of Rivendell was truly remarkable.

"Well then. I suggest you three get some rest and recuperation. Smoke not a few pipefuls of Old Toby, go fishing, do what you want, but meet me here in fifteen days. I bid you all good night." Then he too exited the Pony leaving Gorin, Galamdir and I looking at each other with quizzical expressions on our faces. It seemed there was more at foot than we knew.

"My good sirs and lady." A male servant  brought us a tray with roast meats, cheese, onions, fruit and the Pony's dark molasses bread, and of course ale to wash it all down. "The Green Lady has paid for dinner and your rooms for a fortnight."

### Fellowship

We passed the next fortnight in Bree, our room and board paid for by the Lady Gilraen. Gorin found another group of dwarves that were passing through on their way to somewhere. He spent many hours drinking and smoking, and telling stories with them in the Pony. Galamdir spent more time with her books. While Gorin was telling tall tales to his new friends, Galamdir and I sometimes ventured into the surrounding countryside on picnic, enjoying the fall weather. The trees were aflame with color and the air crisp and clear. It was hard to believe it was just a few weeks ago that we were battling for our lives with the Fell Wraiths of Fornost and Drameth.

But Gorin did not spend all his time in drinking games with his dwarven friends. We three spent good times together as well and our friendships deepened ever further. Even Gorin was good-hearted towards Galamdir. Though he still held elves in contempt, he made an exception for her. And for her part, Galamdir seemed to genuinely like the dwarf. She laughed at his jokes and struggled to solve his riddles.

> Undertaking: Strengthen the Fellowship. +1 Fellowship until next Fellowship Phase.

Over the days and nights we talked with many folk that came into The Pony and heard all sorts of rumors about the goings on here and there. One rumor was told more than once about what the locals called "The Shadow Wanderers". Rumor has it that a group of mysterious individuals, cloaked in dark attire and rarely seen during daylight, have been spotted lurking within the depths of the Chetwood. Some claim they possess an eerie aura, as if they are not entirely of this world. Some whisper that they may be agents of a sinister master, gathering information or plotting nefarious deeds. 

This might be something worth checking out.

### Meeting With Gandalf
October 30, Full Moon

The evening of the full moon we waited in The Pony for Gandalf's arrival. Amidst the clink of tankards and the murmur of travel-worn patrons, your party is approached by a familiar figure cloaked in grey. The long, flowing beard and the piercing eyes beneath the brim of his hat leave no doubt as to who he is. Gandalf the Grey has a task, one that he deems of great importance, not just for the Rangers of the North, but for the preservation of history itself.

![Gandalf.png|200](/img/user/zz_assetts/Gandalf.png)

 "Good evening, my friends. I have come to Bree on a matter that requires both subtlety and resolve. The Chronicles of Annúminas, ancient records of the North Kingdom, have been stolen. They speak of the lineage of kings and the secrets of the Dúnedain, invaluable knowledge that must not fall into the wrong hands.

Their last known location was within a Ranger's cache, secretly kept in the Chetwood, but the cache was found empty. The tracks were peculiar, elusive even, some heading east towards the Misty Mountains, others towards the south. Your task will be to seek the Chronicles and return them to their rightful guardians. I suspect the culprits are not your ordinary bandits, for they cleverly evaded the Rangers' watch. Be wary, and trust not too lightly."

"Galamdir, you've been studying local maps and writings. Have you learned anything about this Chetwood?" I asked.

"Yes. The Chetwood is a forest located to the east of Bree and south of the Great East Road. It is a dense and ancient woodland, known for its tall and thick trees. The Chetwood is a mysterious and somewhat foreboding place, with tales of strange happenings and encounters with creatures such as wolves and spiders.

The Chetwood serves as a natural barrier between Bree-land and the wilder lands to the east. It is a place where travelers and adventurers must exercise caution, as it is easy to get lost within its depths. However, it also provides a source of timber and game for the people of Bree."

And so we prepared to travel the next day into the Chetwood.

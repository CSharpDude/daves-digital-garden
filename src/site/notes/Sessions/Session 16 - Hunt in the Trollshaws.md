### Recap
In Session 15 the company visited Carlson's farm and had a pleasant dinner with him. They then encountered a dwarf assassin on their journey and successfully defeated him. The company continued their journey to the Trollshaws and came across a breathtaking glade. They set up camp there and gained a sense of hope. The next day, they proceeded towards the Trollshaws and crossed into the dangerous forest.

### Log

The next morning we began scouting the area, looking for any clues we might find. It could take a long time to uncover the location of this secretive group, the [[Adversaries/Shadowwing Brotherhood\|Shadowwing Brotherhood]]. About noon, Gorin called out, "Ho! Over here! I've found something." Galamdir and I hurried to his call. He stood on a rock, pointing at the muddy bank of a small, swift stream. "See here? There are traces of footprints in the mud. Similar to the ones we found in Chetwood." I looked but couldn't make them out. He had excellent tracking skills.

They lead directly west, deeper into the forest. And so we set off that afternoon into the elder woods in search of our prey. As we moved quietly through the woods, Gorin motioned for us to stop. He hand-signaled for us to look ahead and to the right.
### The Hideout

It was close to dusk when they discerned the faintly beaten path veering off the main trail. This path, hidden to a casual observer, betrayed signs of recent use. Each member of the party exchanged a knowing glance before they decided to pursue this clue, moving forward with a stealth that belied their urgency.

As the path unwound before them, the trees receded, revealing a rocky outcrop that overshadowed a small, concealed valley. Within this natural hollow lay the secret lair of the [[Adversaries/Shadowwing Brotherhood\|Shadowwing Brotherhood]]. The lair itself was a repurposed Dúnedain watchtower, its once noble form now marred by the Brotherhood's malicious alterations. Shrouded in a murky haze, it stood as a corrupted monument to its former glory, ivy clawing at its weathered stone façade.

The party observed with utmost caution. They noted the sentries: hooded figures clothed in dark garb, armed with short swords and crossbows, patrolling the perimeter with a lazy unprofessionalism that spoke of overconfidence. Two stood watch at the main entrance, a heavy oaken door reinforced with bands of black iron, while others patrolled the grounds, occasionally pausing to exchange hushed words or obscure hand signals.

Activity within the shadow-enshrouded courtyard betrayed the enemy's presence. They could see other members of the Brotherhood handling crates and scroll cases with the cavalier disrespect one would not expect for such valuable items. The way these figures moved and interacted suggested a mix of cutthroat bandits and deluded cultists, united under a banner of darkness.

The structure's defenses appeared more reliant on its hidden location than formidable construction. The watchtower, though sturdy, bore signs of neglect. Moss-eaten battlements and a partially collapsed side wall spoke of vulnerabilities that the party could exploit. Arrow slits hinted at the presence of archers within, but given the dereliction of certain sections, it was uncertain how many would be stationed for an internal defense.

Smoke curled lazily from a stone chimney, indicating that there were fires burning inside, possibly in a hearth of a common room – a likely place where the Brotherhood may keep their pilfered goods and, with fortune smiling upon them, the stolen Chronicles. The party, aware that the cover of darkness was their ally, prepared to make their move under the cloak of night, relying on the element of surprise to overcome the [[Adversaries/Shadowwing Brotherhood\|Shadowwing Brotherhood]] and reclaim the lost tomes.

We retreated into a small valley between two rocky ledges to discuss our options. "We canna hit them head on. There's too many, and well armed at at that." remarked Gorin.

"Gorin's right. We could use the cover of darkness to sneak into the tower. I noticed a break in the west wall that may allow us entry unnoticed. But we do not know what we may encounter within. Or we could withdraw and provide Gandalf with this location. Perhaps a raid could be staged. what do you think Ereborn?"

I thought about it for a few moments before answering. This would be the most dangerous mission we had yet attempted if we proceeded. What other options did we have? "We might be able to create a diversion that would draw many or most of the Brotherhood out of the tower. It could also keep the other's attention diverted from our, um, visit."

"What kind of diversion?" Galamdir asked and then added thoughtfully, "If we could encourage some local trolls to attack, that might work. This **is** the Trollshaws. How hard could it be to find a family of trolls?"

Gorin nodded his head and smiled wryly. We decided to search and see if we could locate a nearby troll home.

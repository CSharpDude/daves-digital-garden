### Recap
The company successfully found the lair of the Shadowwing Brotherhood in the Trollshaws. They devised a plan to lead a family of Trolls to attack the tower, allowing them to sneak in unnoticed. After setting up camp and luring the trolls towards the tower, creating a distraction as trolls attacked and Amdiriel snuck inside to retrieve the Chronicles of Annuminas. They managed to escape with the scrolls and were met by Gandalf on their way to Bree, where they delivered the Chronicles to their guardian.

"Rest for several days my friends. I suppose you will be wanting to get back to Rivendell?" asked Gandalf.

"Yes. Amdiriel and I will celebrate Yule there and Gorin I think will be heading home for a visit." I answered.

"Aye, I've much to tell my folk about the things we've found. They'll want to know. And I have a few trinkets to store as well!" he said with a twinkle in his eye.

"Good. Good. When you are ready to leave I have a favor to ask of you on your way back to see Gilraen. Nothing much. Will hardly be a bother at all. Good day." And with that Gandalf left the Prancing Pony.

While we were talking to some of the Bree-folk one of them told us this story:

[[Rumors/Rumors\|Rumors]]
"One of the traders from Tharbad, he was, with a cart full of foreign wares. Came through here not a fortnight ago, and said he'd be staying at the Forsaken Inn on the Great East Road for the night, before heading back south. No one's seen hide nor hair of him since. They say the inn's been deserted for years, but he was adamant it's under new management. Some travelers claim to see lights in the windows from a distance, but the closer they get, everything goes dark. Folks are startin' to whisper about ghosts, or worse..."

## Meeting  With [[Patrons/Gandalf\|Gandalf]]
As the company prepared to leave the comfort of the Prancing Pony in Bree, Gandalf, cloaked and enigmatic, beckoned them to a discreet corner. His eyes hold the depth of ancient wisdom as he speaks in a hushed tone, ensuring the conversation remains private.

"My dear friends," he begins, the weight of countless journeys etched into his voice, "Your path leads you eastward towards Rivendell, but along the way, I have a matter most urgent that requires your assistance. The Rangers of the North, those valiant guardians of the wild, need to be warned of stirrings that may threaten the peace of these lands."

Gandalf produced a sealed parchment, its wax bearing the sigil of Elrond. "This missive contains word of movements and rumors that speak of an unease awakening within the very shadows of this region. It must be delivered into the hands of Halbarad, the Ranger leader who dwells in the Angle south of Rivendell."

He leaned in closer, a glint of serious intent sparking in his eye. "The Angle lies between the rivers Mitheithel and Bruinen, south of the Last Homely House. You will find the Rangers secluded there, a hidden refuge among the rolling hills and dense woodlands, in a place known as the Stoor Pool. Halbarad awaits you there in a camp nearby."

Gandalf passed the sealed note to Ereborn with clear instructions, "Keep this secret; keep it safe. This information could tip the balance should ill tidings turn to war. The Rangers are elusive, but they know the land as one knows the back of their own hand. Trust their signals if you find them—white stones on the path, a feather hanging from a branch—they'll guide you. You know of what I speak, Ereborn. You've been there."

"Be wary on your journey," he cautioned. "These lands are old, and not all that is old is friendly to the traveler. Use discretion, for not all eyes that watch the road are kind. And time, as ever, is of the essence."

With a nod, the company assured the wizard that his charge will be met, and they gathered their gear to set out at once. Gandalf watched them go but remained behind. His thoughts were clouded just as much with hope as with worry. Dusk fell upon Bree as the company set their feet upon the East Road, their hearts buoyed by the gravity of the task entrusted to them by the Grey Pilgrim himself.

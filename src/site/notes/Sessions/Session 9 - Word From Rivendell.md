### Recap
In Session 8, the Fellowship arrived in Bree after their encounter with Barrow Wights. They sought refuge at the Prancing Pony inn and were approached by a ranger named Basil, who delivered a letter from Gilraen the Fair. After confirming Basil's trustworthiness, they gave him a letter in return. The company then spent time resting and writing songs, with Gorin composing a victory song about their Barrow Downs adventure. Galamdir and Ereborn visited Reeve's Hall, a hidden treasure trove of knowledge, where they studied maps and writings. They received word from Gilraen after two weeks of waiting in Bree.
### Log


It was about noon on the 27th of September when we returned to The Pony. We had gone fishing in a nearby brook and had a nice breakfast of roasted trout. The barkeep motioned us over straight away. "There's a fellow here what's looking for you. Tall fellow in the back smokin' a long pipe."

"Thanks" I said and we moved to meet our visitor. "Hail good sir. Can we help you?"

"Not here. Is there somewhere more private and, ah, quiet that we cold talk?" There was an unused private room behind the tap. I motioned for him to follow us. A glance at Gorin told him to be ready in case of danger.

There was a large, heavy oaken table in the center of the room with several heavy chairs surrounding it. Gorin pulled one chair to the side so he could watch the door and the table. Galamdir sat at the end of the table opposite the door and I took a chair across the table from our "friend".

"OK. Now who are you? What do you want with us?" The man did not answer but instead showed us the crest of Gilraen and handed us a sealed letter. 

"Read it later. Gilraen has a message for you and a request. She says the information you sent has been quite helpful and confirmed her suspicions about the barrows. She appreciates what you have done and sends her respects". He place a small leather sack on the table which made a chinking sound as it landed. " Gilraen would like you to travel north to Fornost. It seems there are other undead that need putting to rest. Also she wants you to find an Elf named Nalien, if you can. She is, um, quite distressed and Gilraen is worried about her. They once were very close but Nalien has not been herself. Everything you need to know, more than I know, is in the letter. Use the coin to buy supplies. Get what you need."

He got up to leave. "Just a minute laddie." barked Gorin. "That's all ye have ta say? We're just to go to this Fornost? And then what? Look fer ghosts and missing elf girl?"

"Everything is in the letter. I've told you all I know - all I was told." and he walked into the hall way. "Sorry, but I have business elsewhere and I am late."

"What do ye make of that! Not so even a polite good-bye. Read the letter and let's see what we're bein' asked to do."

"It's in Sindarin. Galamdir it might be best of you read it to us. My Sindarin is..."

"Lacking." she said with a smile that she meant what she said but was amused by it. "Give it here." Galamdir read the letter to us and began to transcribe it in common in case we needed to read it on our journey. 

"Well then. We'll be off in the mornin' I would wager. I'll see about stocking our supplies and tending to the horses." Gorin said as he stood up.

"Use this." I said, tossing him the leather pouch. "I think we should leave at first light."

" What do you know about Fornost?" Galamdir said to both of us. "There is much to tell but the short version is this. Before the city of Fornost Erain fell, and the kingdom of Arnor was destroyed, the last king of the North sent messengers south with a
desperate plea for assistance. Eärnur, prince of Gondor, answered the call, and a great army landed at the Elven havens. They arrived too late to save Arnor, but they met the Witch-king of Angmar on the plains west of Fornost and defeated him.  It is a grom place.”

That evening we let Barnabas Butterbur, the innkeeper know we were leaving the next morning. He asked where to and before I could respond, Gorin blurted out "Fornost, in the north" before I could stop him.

"We'd appreciate it if you would keep that private" I said glaring at Gorin who just shrugged an embarrassed shrug.

"You be careful up there good sirs. There's some strange rumors goin' round about that place. They say it's haunted!" And then more quietly he said "They say centuries ago, a terrible battle was fought on the plains west of Deadmen’s Dike. They say it was a great victory for the King, but one that came at grievous cost. The battlefield is haunted to this day, as the land itself cannot forget such terrible sorrow. In recent times, a woman has been seen wandering the plains alone, as one who has lost her way. Some say it’s a spirit, others think she’s an Elf, a princess maybe.”

Galamdir muttered "Sometimes there is truth in old wives tales."

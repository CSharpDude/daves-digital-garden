### Recap
In Session 11, the Fellowship continued their search for Drameth. Galamdir took on the task of calming Nalien, who was on the verge of madness. They camped near the battlefield and set off early to search for Drameth. After two days of searching, they discovered Blossum Mound, a hill where Halfling archers had fought bravely in the battle. They took shelter from the rain and rested. They then headed north from the mound and reached the Northern Slopes, where Nalien remembered seeing Drameth riding alongside Prince Ëarnur of Gondor. They decided to journey north to complete their quest. That night, they all had a dream of Nalien and Drameth fighting together in a great battle. They continued their journey through the grey, windy country and reached the Sheltered Fields, where Nalien sensed that it was the spot where Drameth fell in battle.

### Drameth
Out of the gloom sprang unearthly cries whose horrid sound chilled blood and froze  resolve. Three Fell Wraiths emerged from the surrounding fog, glowing eyes burning with contempt for the living. Then on an overlooking ledge She appeared, both terrible and beautiful - Drameth! Pale skin like death and long white hair that billowed like a ships sails in the wind. Shivers of fear and wonder grabbed at my heart.

Nalien let out a cry "Oh Drameth! I am so sorry my dear friend. It is not too late! Come with me and depart middle earth. You are not houseless. You have me." Drameth looked at her and for a moment I think a saw recognition in her cold eyes. But they soon burned again with hatred as she pointed her spear at us and the Wraiths attacked.

Galamdir sent an arrow at Drameth which found its mark. Drameth growled at her in anger and moved to attack  but I managed to intercept her. I swung Shadowbane at the Drameth-wraith and connected. She wailed in pain and struck back with her spear, catching me off guard. A second wraith joined in her attack against me.

Gorin had two of his own wraiths to contend with. One he struck with a mighty blow but it refused to go down. The other struck at Gorin with and ornate axe and he grunted in pain. Nalien kept pleading with Drameth to stop the attack and leave with her, Galamdir added her voice to the cause, but Drameth paid them no heed. The bloodlust pumping through her ethereal veins was all she could hear.

But perhaps it did distract her, just slightly. I gathered all my strength, called on Shadowbane to strike true, and swung at the beautiful but deadly apparition facing me. As Shadowbane cleaved ethereal flesh I saw first pain and then relief in her eyes. She grimaced and then looked toward Nalien with a weak smile. Drameth hung in the air with that smile for a few mesmerizing moments. Then she was gone.

When Drameth disappeared the remaining Wraiths retreated back into the shadows. Nalien screamed in anguish and collapsed beside Galamdir who moved to comfort her. Looking at Gorin, I saw the relief on his face. These were terrible foes we had faced. We would have been hard pressed to triumph had the other Wraiths not disappeared when Drameth was defeated. 

Nalien calmed down after a while and seemed more lucid than ever we had seen her. Thanking Galamdir she rose to her feet. "I believe that Drameth is finally at rest and is houseless no more. I would have wanted it to end differently but perhaps this is the only path open to her. Thank you all for caring for me while I was - somewhere else in my mind."

"Now I am ready to sail from Middle Earth. I will make my way to the Grey Havens. Again you have my thanks. Before I go, I leave you with these gifts." Nalien removed her bow from her shoulder and laid it in Galamdir's hands. "This is Thaliondir - the Starlight Bow, made by the bow-master Aerandir. It is said he infused the light of the stars in it, providing guidance to the arrows that fly from it, even in darkness."

"To you Ereborn I leave Elessar's Grace." She held out a beautiful crystal pendant. "Call upon it when your wounds are great."

"Finally to you master dwarf, I leave something from your own people. It was given to me many years ago. It is named the Belt of Old Erebor and it will help ease your burden."

We all bowed and gave our thanks, even Gorin who holds elves with suspicion. With that she turned and touched foreheads with Galamdir. As we watched, Nalien headed westwards into the mist away from Fornost, on her way to the Grey Havens and on to The Undying Lands. 

Galamdir watched as she disappeared into the fog. "I think we foiled a plan of the Enemy this day. I do not know what plans were meant for Drameth, but I think had we not intervened, many would have suffered at her hands." Galamdir sighed and turned back towards us. "Let us leave these battle fields as soon as we can. My spirit is grieved here."

We headed south, back to the Greenway and then to Bree once more.

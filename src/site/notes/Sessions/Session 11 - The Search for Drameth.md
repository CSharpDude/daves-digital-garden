### Recap
In Session 10, the Fellowship left Bree and traveled along the ancient North Road towards Fornost. The journey was slow and challenging, with the road in disrepair. They camped under fir trees, fished for food, and encountered the distant howls of wolves. As they approached Fornost, they were greeted by a desolate and ruined city, filled with a sense of profound desolation. They decided to search the ruins for treasure but ultimately followed Gilraen's message to the Fields of Slaughter. There, they found the elf Nalien being pursued by orcs. The Fellowship engaged in a fierce battle, with Gorin and Ereborn sustaining injuries. They managed to defeat the orcs and save Nalien, who revealed her mission to find her friend Drameth's shade. The Fellowship now faces a decision on how to proceed, as Nalien's madness grows and they must choose whether to follow her or prioritize their own recovery.
### Log


Galamdir took on the ministry to Nalien, who continued to babble and promised at any moment run away screaming. But Galamdir seemed to calm her, at least for a time.  We camped that night not far from our battle ground. In the morning we set off early to search for Drameth. Galamdir led us by a winding way, both to cover the ground completely and to allow time for us to heal. We could not remain still to heal or Nalien would have run off. 
### Blossum Mound
Two days we searched the battlefield, slowly heading west. On the third day we found a series of small mounds covered by blankets of colorful flowers, even at this time of year. With a faint smile, Nalien recalled that this hill is where a small formation of Halfling archers made their contribution to the battle, loyal subjects of the King of Arnor, even after his death. The Hobbits’ accurate volleys helped slow the advance of the Witch-king’s Orc armies, and many among them fell, hit by the black-feathered arrows that the Orcs shot in return. When the battle was finished, the survivors planted flowers on the site, to commemorate their fallen comrades. Their sacrifice is almost unknown to the world.

We took shelter under a nearby copse of trees as the weather had turned foul and rains poured from heavens like the Falls of Raunos. And so we passed our third day since the battle with the orcs. Gorin and I, though not yet fully healed, began to have our strength return.

### The Northern Slope
We continued our search to the north from the Blossum Mound. The land rose gently and then fell away again. In a moment of lucidity, Nalien recalled that Drameth did not arrive here with the main alliance forces, because she was part of the wing of cavalry which fell upon Angmar’s retreating forces descending here from the north.

She remembered catching sight of Drameth briefly as she charged on her horse alongside Prince Ëarnur of Gondor, her spear shining in the gloom with a gleam of chill flame. She recalled how the sight rejuvenated her spirit after a day of harrowing violence. The last she saw of Ëarnur and Drameth was them turning north in pursuit of the fleeing Witch-king.

Nalien fell silent, full of regret for not being with her friend in her last moments. It was  clear to us that we must journey north to complete our quest. We encamped on the Northern Slopes and headed northward early in the morning. Gorin and I had fully healed by this time. Galamdir's ploy had worked. But the weight of the Shadow in these cursed lands weighed heavily on all of us. We could  sense another presence, one of pure evil.

That night we all three shared a dream. A great battle was being fought on these very slopes. The Witch King's army was pressing the Elven forces. Two elves seemed to rise above the fray, fighting side-by-side, the enemy fleeing before their slaughter. It was Nalien and Drameth. I knew it was Drameth though of course I had never seen her. Together they seemed an unstoppable force as their enemies fell easily before them. 

We did not speak of this dream but we all knew what we had each seen - Nalien and Drameth together in battle.

### The Sheltered Fields
It was a miserable ride through grey, windy country that awaited us as we marched along the route taken long ago by those who pursued the Witch-king in his flight. It was a northeasterly trek, bringing the us ever closer to the foothills of the North Downs. It was not clear how Nalien could discern the path to follow, but she never seemed to hesitate. When the Company had travelled for about thirty miles, we reached a spot close to the eaves of a wood bordering the North Downs. 

The cry of the wind gave way to absolute silence, hanging like a cloud over a pool of still, shallow water. Though Nalien was never here before, she suddenly knew that it was on this precise spot that the bodyguard of the Witch-king stopped to face their pursuers, to allow their leader to continue in his flight. Standing as if paralyzed, Nalien told us the story of how a hand-picked company of cruel, black-clad riders of Angmar faced the host of Elves and Men of Gondor, and died killing many. 

Among those who fell under their blows was Drameth.

### Recap
In Session 1 of the "Opposing the Shadow" campaign, the party received a quest from Gilraen to find a missing Ranger named Arondar. They embarked on a journey from Rivendell to Hobbiton, stopping in Bree along the way. During their travels, they encountered a joyful sight of a white stag, found shortcuts that saved them time, and had a chance meeting with another ranger who provided information about Eodred, the missing Ranger. In Bree, they discovered that Eodred had helped a widow named Elsura Fogbottom deal with ruffians who had stolen a locket from her husband's grave. Eodred then left for Hobbiton. The party continued their journey to Hobbiton, encountering eagles and a minor injury along the way. In Hobbiton, they learned that Eodred may have gone to a tower near Weathertop and decided to investigate further.

Hearing that Eodred left with a farmer known well in Bree, we decided to ask about the farmer in Bree. Hopefully when we find the farmer, we'll find our missing ranger.

When we reached the Brandywine bridge, I was fortunate to locate a quicker path that saved us about a day of travel. Our spirits were lifted by our good luck and we slept exceptionally well that night.

The next day a farmer with an empty cart came by and offered us a ride as far as the Greenway. Indeed our luck was increasing! "Argh" spat Gorin. "It won't last, laddie. Ne'er does."

July 29
We entered Gby the south gate and made our way towards the Prancing Pony.

Just as we entered the gate...
> A young boy rides into Bree, causing a great stir and commotion. His mount is an old farm-horse, ill-suited to the lad’s desperate ride, but having carried out its duty bravely. It has been ridden near to death on the journey. The lad is in little better shape, with a broken off arrow jutting from an ill-bandaged wound.

> He tells a tale of goblin folk descending  on his family’s cottage at the old Eye tower a little East of Weathertop.  He weeps as he recounts how his older brother died with spear in hand and his father Carlson fell, clubbed by a Great Orc that towered above its fellows as he bought time for young Alfred, his mother and sisters to escape. Their farmhand Giles was with them, but Giles is no fighter unlike Alfred’s brother or Carlson. He is desperate for someone to return and rescue his father, who he is convinced must still be alive and find his siblings and mother.

Could this be the Carlson we are searching for? Could these Orcs be the reason Eodred went with Carlson? Alfred confirmed that his father brought a man back with him and he had stayed with them for some time.

**Old Lore via a Lore success**

“The Rangers have long protected Rhudaur’s Eye, as it was said to house a great treasure of their line, but one that they were reluctant to unseat from the Eye. The Seat of the Eye was the place of honour for the Knight of the Eye, and it is said that it granted discipline to his soldiers. The Rangers believed some old magic of the seat helped Carl Ferrick and his descendants reform, despite Rhudaur’s cruel reputation. Their ongoing protection means the Eye may hold other treasures, beyond the Seat itself.

The Eye was built and named as Rhudaur envied the Fortress of Amon Sul at Weathertop, explaining the proximity of another Dunedain tower.”

> You are aware of tales that the Knight of Rhudaur was allowed to keep an tenth of the tolls he extracted and an old rhyme claims these were hidden behind the third stone up from the floor in the corner of the master’s bedroom, for the successor Kingdoms were forged when Arnor was broken into three Kingdoms and the number three was considered lucky.

We decide to leave immediately with Alfred in the hopes of finding his family and Eodred. As we approach the gate, Galamdir throws a copper in the fountain.

![Gorin 1.png|inlL|75](/img/user/zz_assetts/Gorin%201.png)"What was that for? " Gorin exclaimed. "I coulda used that at the Prancing Pony if yer jes throwin it away!"

![Galamdir.png|inlL|75](/img/user/zz_assetts/Galamdir.png)"It is an old Bree custom that is supposed to bring luck" she laughed.
Galamdir gets 1d on the first journey event she faces.

We headed west on the Great East Road with Alfred as our guide to lead us to his home and on then to Rhudaur’s Eye. What would we find? Is Eodred alive? What about Alfred's father, mother and Giles?

### Recap
In Session 6 of the Fellowship's journey in Middle-earth, they left Rivendell and traveled towards Bree. Along the way, they faced challenges such as a flooded road and a lone wolf, but managed to overcome them. In Bree, they learned about strange lights and rumors of a wight-king gathering the dead in the Barrow Downs. They encountered a group of bandits on their way to the Barrow Downs and successfully fought them off. They then noticed flickering lights in the distance and decided to make camp before venturing into the Barrows. Galamdir made a joke about being distracted by the lights. As they settled down for the night, the protagonist decided to rename their sword "Man-belthor" to "Shadow-bane."
### Log


I woke everyone before sunrise. We had a quick breakfast of dry rations as we did not want to chance a fire. Galamdir directed us to the location where she saw the lights last evening. The barrow mounds rose and dipped beside us like waves on a sea of green as we walked. About mid-day we approached the area where the lights had been dancing. The fog, always present on the downs, became thicker and the air felt heavy the further we went.

The atmosphere of this place felt as if the very ground around us was against us and that at any time a nameless horror might ambush us from deep within the fog. Day seemed to turn to night and fear nipped at our heels. But we were no strangers to dreadful things and were not so easily thwarted.

Pointing her graceful hand at a large barrow, Galamdir whispered "It is just up ahead - the source of the lights. See that barrow? The one that is much larger than the others? That is the one." As we stood before the massive stone entrance to the large barrow, Gorin shouted a warning. 

"Look out laddie! We aren't alone here!" A group of what once were men, grey and gaunt, looking more dead than alive charged at us from around the great mound. We had little time to react. 

"Barrow people" exclaimed Galamdir. I had heard tales of these creatures, but thought them to be myth and superstition.

They were armed with long ancient swords and dressed in rags with no armor that Ereborn could see. They moved with great speed, three attacked Gorin and two Ereborn. Galamdir had swiftly moved a distance away and readied her bow. With a mighty yell, Gorin bellowed a dwarven war cry and the Barrow Men took a step back. Ereborn swung  Shadowbane and connected with the nearest opponent, but the other's sword also hit him in the left shoulder. Galamdir's arrow flew true and lodged in the shoulder of one of the men attacking Gorin.

Then Gorin's axe came down and nearly cleaved a barrow man in two. Another barrow man swung at Gorin but he deftly avoided the blow with quick side step. The other barrow man saw an opening and hit Gorin hard. His chain shirt deflected the blow but it shook him badly. Ereborn finished one man and Galamdir injured another. 

Again Gorn's axe swung true and now he faced only one opponent. Ereborn's sword also found it's mark and his foe's replay went wide. Galamdir's arrow pierced his left eye sending him flying backwards. He was dead before he landed. Once more Gorin's axe swung with overpowering force and pierced the man's armor, the mighty blow sending him to his grave.

Gorin took a beating and it showed. These barrow men were fierce warriors even if they did not have the best gear. We rested for about an hour after which Gorin rose to his feet. "What're we watin' fer ye lazy marsh dwellers! Let's open this forsaken tomb and find out what's causing this here light! Could be there's treasure too!" And we stood to our feet and stepped into the darkness.

Ereborn lit a torch whose light seemed to be in battle with the overwhelming darkness. The air was rank and musty. It smelled of death. Galamdir stopped us and pointing to engraved marks on the wall. "These marks are fresh. They are black speech. The enemy has or has had an agent here. This is no mere barrow!"

Then as we turned a corner the pathway opened up into a larger room with a massive sarcophagus in the center on a raised platform of roughly hewn stone. From behind us, blocking our only exit, a hissing, raspy voice came saying " Good, good. You will make fine servants for the Master. You are much stronger than the pale things that live here. They are easy to control, but weak and pitiful."

We turned around and before us stood a dreadful Barrow Wight. We froze silently for a moment, transfixed by the Wight's horrible visage. The silence was broken by the "Whoosh!" of an arrow loosed from Galamdir's bow. Her aim was true and the Wight was struck heavily. I let an arrow fly and it too hit the dark creature hard, knocking it back.

We closed the distance to the Wight and Gorin swung is great axe hitting the wraith in the right shoulder. It screamed but the blow that would have killed a living foe could not stop one of the dead. The monster seemed to rage against us with even more fury and shook off both blows like a dog shakes water from his fur. 

I closed in and swung Shadowbane just as the wraith reached for Gorin's throat with a glowing, gnarled hand. The blade sliced through ethereal armor and skin as if it were living flesh and bone. The wraith screamed such a horrible scream that we all raised out hands to cover our ears in pain. The dark form writhed and twisted in agony, and  disappeared in a swirling cloud of smoke and ash. It was then that I remembered the words of Gilraen: 

"*This is the Blade of Arahel from Númenór. It is also called Mán-belthor, the wraith-slayer. It carries a powerful enchantment against undead and certain evil men.... Ereborn, Mán-belthor may prove useful on your journey*".

"Even with the enchantments of Man-belthor, that was a skillful blow" remarked Galamdir. "A powerful weapon in the hands of one who is worthy of it." Her gaze fixed on me for a moment and then turning towards the chamber entrance ,she said "We must remain watchful. There is no telling what other horrors may yet lurk here."

Gorin stomped the ground where the Wraith had just stood as if he were putting out a campfire. "Where'd he go? I was just about to show him a bit o' dwarf fury! Well then, let's find some treasure! Must be some choice trinkets in this old crypt." and he began to search the room in earnest.

For my part, I did not know what to think. One blow had killed a powerful foe (if a Wraith can be killed). I could not help feeling that fortune had been with us, not just a swordsman's skills. "At least now we know what has been going on here. The Enemy is or was attempting to raise an army from the Barrow People."

"This Wight did not act alone. He himself was stirred by something greater than he. This has happened once before long ago" and Galamdir described when the Wraith King had tried to raise the Wights long ago. "We must report this to Gilraen."

We did find treasure, though not as much as Gorin hoped. We found many coins and one curious object: a ring inscribed in Sindarin. "Duilin Loremaster" read Galamdir. "I believe this ring belonged to perhaps the greatest loremaster Middle Earth has ever seen. He died by a Balrog's arrow in battle. Duilin of Gondolin he was called. A chief of the Swallows of old."

We loaded the treasure onto our horses and made our way to the Greenway where we made camp for the night. Tomorrow we would head back To Bree.

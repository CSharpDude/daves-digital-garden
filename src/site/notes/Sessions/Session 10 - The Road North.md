### Recap
In Session 9, the Fellowship returned to the Prancing Pony inn in Bree after their encounter with Barrow Wights. They were approached by a ranger named Basil, who delivered a letter from Gilraen the Fair. After confirming Basil's trustworthiness, they received the letter and a small leather sack of coins. Gilraen requested their help in traveling north to Fornost to deal with more undead and find a distressed Elf named Nalien. Gorin expressed skepticism, but they decided to read the letter and prepare for their journey. They informed the innkeeper of their departure and learned of rumors about Fornost being haunted.
### Log


We left Bree behind once again on the 23rd of September. The ancient North Road, once bustling with traders and travelers, was now a cracked and overgrown path. Mile markers, weathered and moss-covered, stood as silent sentinels to a bygone era.  

The worn and crumbling road made for slower going than we had anticipated. It had been four days and we were just halfway to our destination. We made camp under a group of fir trees just off the road. There was a clear-running stream nearby and we tried our hand at fishing. We caught a few mountain trout and settled in for a quiet meal under the stars. The sounds of wolves in the distance kept our attention. "Do you want to take first watch, Ereborn?" quipped Galamdir with a wry smile.

The next day we rose to a chill wind from the north. It was almost October and fall was  fast approaching. We made good time that day. The weather was cold and damp, but the sun shown brighter and warmer as the day went on. The following day an eerie fog rolled in overnight. Trees in the distance looked like contorted creatures from a child's nightmare and sounds were muffled, the quiet adding to the gloomy air. 

We crested a small knoll and in the distance, the skeletal spires of Fornost pierced the mist, casting long, jagged shadows across the desolate plains. Bannerless flagpoles clawed at the sky, where once proud banners fluttered in the wind. The air carried a faint, melancholic hum, like a bard's mournful song on a windswept moor. This was the lament of the city itself, a constant reminder of its fallen grace.

As we approached the city, once a proud and gleaming capital of the North Kingdom, a sense of profound desolation washed over us. The city lay in ruins, shrouded in a mist that seemed to cling to its shattered walls and skeletal towers. Yet, even in decay, Fornost whispered tales of its former glory and the tragic events that led to its downfall.

The great gates of Fornost lay shattered, their bronze hinges groaning in the wind. Thorns and brambles crawled through the cracks, reclaiming the entrance for nature.
Crumbling stone houses lined the deserted streets, their windows gaping like empty eye sockets. Vines and ivy draped over the facades, weaving a tapestry of decay and forgotten beauty. Statues of bygone heroes and kings lay toppled and broken, their faces weathered by time and etched with the sorrow of the city's fall.

"Should we enter the city or turn west towards the Fields of Slaughter? Gilraen's message said to search there for Nalien. She must have good reason to tell us to look to the west." offered Galamdir.

"Aye, she did say just that. But I'd be wantin' to search these ruins. There's no tellin' how much treasure we might find!" Gorin's eyes glowed brightly at the promise of the unknown treasures of Fornost.

I gave a nod to Gorin. "Yes, there may be treasure, perhaps much treasure hiding in these forsaken walls. There is also danger. Tales tell of the ghosts of the former inhabitants and powerful undead creatures that stalk the empty streets. We should begin with Gilraen's message. Our path may bring us into the depths of the city. But our first priority is finding this Nalien."

And so we turned west into the vast fields where a great battle had been fought so long ago. Galamdir often stood in her saddle, her keen eyes searching the horizon for signs of the elf Nalien. After a time Gorin bade us to halt. He had discovered signs of a single person passing this way. We followed the trail through the barren ground until Galamdir cryed "I've found her. There on the horizon near that great oak tree. She is running this way. She is being pursued!"

We urged our horses onward at a gallop and soon I could see the elf women running towards us. "She is being chased by orcs!"

We soon reached the nearly exhausted elf. Three orcs came running behind her. One orc larger than the others called out "She is ours! Turn aside or we will kill you and feed you to the wargs!"

"She is no one's but her own!" retorted Galamdir! "Leave this field or die!" She loosed an arrow at the only orc with a bow, hitting him squarely in the chest. I followed with an arrow of my  own that took him down quickly.

Then we all sang our combat song [[Songs/A Barrow Victory\|A Barrow Victory]]. New energy seemed to flow through my veins and I could see Galamdir felt it as well. But Gorin was focused on the great orc facing us and readied his axe.

I swung Shadowbane at the nearest orc and knocked him off his feet, leaving hime badly injured. Gorin's axe found it's mark on the great orc but it didn't go down. Just then three more orc soldiers stepped out of the brush and joined the fray. Galamdir's bow took out the first orc before he closed the gap.

In a fit of rage the great orc swung his scimitar at Gorin. Gorin's armor rang with the power of the fierce blow, but stopped most of the weapon's force. 

Gorin's axe found it's mark once again. This time relieving the great orc of its hideous head. A second orc engaged me as I finished off his comrade. This allowed him to get inside my defense and pierce my armor. Pain seared through my body as the blade struck bone. 

A second orc's spear found it's mark on Gorin. He went down clutching his side and lost consciousness. But Galamdir's bow exacted swift revenge, piercing the orc in the neck. He fell dead alongside Gorin.

All this time, the elf woman stood by as if she were watching a play. Now she took her spear and jabbed the remaining orc who winced in pain. Alone on the field, facing three opponents, he broke of and ran.

Holding my side I gasped in pain, but I was more concerned about Gorin. Nalien moved to Gorin's side and produced bandages and medicine from her pouch. After tending to him for a short time, his eyes opened and he let out a great groan. "Where is that oversize toad! I'll chop his head off. Oh, my head hurts!"

"Just rest now it will take several days for you to recover, even with Elven healing. Now it is your turn sir. Let me see that wound."

Ereborn and Gorin are wounded and require 4 days to recover. Nalien is lucid now but madness is clawing at her mind. Even now she mumbles to herself, moreso as time goes on. She has one purpose -  to find her lifelong friend Drameth's shade which she believes haunts the area. Could this be the agent of the Enemy Gilraen wants us to deal with? How will we handle this situation? If we go with Nalien now, Gorin and I are vulnerable in battle. If she leaves and we do not follow, we may never find her again. She is our best lead right now. Choose wisely.

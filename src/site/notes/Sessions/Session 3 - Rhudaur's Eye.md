### Recap
In Session 2 of the "Opposing the Shadow" campaign in the world of TOR, the party returned to Bree in search of a missing ranger named Eodred. They encountered a young boy named Alfred who had escaped from goblins attacking his family's cottage near Weathertop. Alfred believed his father, Carlson, was still alive and asked for help in rescuing him. The party successfully tended to Alfred's wounds and convinced the people of Bree to offer aid. They then set off towards Rhudaur's Eye, guided by Alfred, hoping to find Eodred and the missing family members.
### Log


We set out for Rhudaur's Eye with the boy Alfred in tow. The horses provided by the townspeople of Bree made our journey seem light. As we approached the south passing of Weathertop, the skies opened and again we saw great eagles soaring in the heavens. A truly inspiring sight!

#### Approaching the Eye
**
Rhudaur’s Eye was founded on jealousy and rivalry, deliberately built by the young kingdom of Rhudaur as a pale imitation of the nearby fortress of Amon Sul, now better known as Weathertop.

It is surprisingly sturdy, despite the long years that have passed since it was built. The Dunedain built to last, and the Rangers cared for the Eye even long after Rhudaur fell. Carl Ferrick and his descendants have taken to living in a similarly sturdy wood and stone hut that once served the eye, occasionally repairing their home with stone from the Eye’s outlying stable and storehouse.

The eye itself is spread over four floors, with a hall, kitchen, barracks, master bedroom and further rooms, their use long lost to history.

Alfred led us to a small hill from which we could observe the Eye. The enemy had encamped just outside of the tower entrance. We could see several tents and a cookfire in the center of the camp. Off to one side a man was tied to a rough post. The largest of the orcs, perhaps their chieftain poked at the man and laughed.  Four orc soldiers sat around the campfire and two archers watched the chieftain taunt the prisoner.

We silently maneuvered ourselves closer to the camp but remained hidden in the brush and trees. We told Alfred to stay where he was and to run back to Bree if things went awry. 

Galamdir struck the first blow, sending an arrow into the shoulder of the chieftain. Gorin and I let loose our arrows as well. The orc camp was in confusion, and Gorin and I attacked head-on while Galamdir continued to let arrows fly. The chieftain fell under her barrage, while three orc soldiers attacked Gorin. I felled on soldier and Gorin another but he had taken a beating. Two orc archers fired back at Galamdir but she avoided their shots. moving swiftly along the tree line.

Another orc fell under Gorin's axe and the archer moved into melee range. In another few minutes all of the orcs lay dead in their camp, but Gorin had paid a heavy price.

We freed the man who was tied to the post. He had been beaten by the orcs but was not badly injured. Just then Alfred burst from the bushes. "Da, Da!" he cried.

"Alfred! What are you doing here? Is your mother safe? The others, where are they?"

"I, I don't know. They ran into the woods. I don't think the orcs found them. I don't know."

I explained how Alfred had run all the way to Bree and how we found him at the gate 2 days ago. Carlson of course wanted to search for his family and we agreed to help him. 

Gorin found a small strongbox while we were talking and forced it open. Inside there was a small amount of treasure including a gold ring with a brilliant white gem. "This is dwarven if I have a beard! From Beleriand." There were also several other trinkets and a few gold pieces.

>Party gains 9 treasure

A quick search of the battle site revealed two other items. "Look at this!" exclaimed Gorin. He held an ornately inscribed war horn with golden ends in his hand. Reading the runes out loud he said "This is the horn of Begrev Stonecrusher. May all who hear it's call take heart." His eye grew wide , "This is a rare find indeed! Stonecrusher was a mighty warrior. It's said that when he blew his horn, weariness fled from all who heard it."

> The Horn of Begrev, Enhearten +2d, Shadow +1

I noticed a scabbard set aside from the orcish weapon stands. It contained a finely made but unadorned long sword. " That is a Númenórean bladem Ranger. The legacy of your kin. May I examine it more closely?"

I handed her the longsword. Running her slender fingers over the hilt and blade. "Yes, this is Dúnedain. It has a magically keen edge. More I cannot say. Perhaps Gilraen will know further. You should show it to her when we return."

Galamdir was able to identify these as Orcs coming from Mount Gram due to the crude mountain insignia on their shields and their equipment. Would they return? Likely given the camp they left.

We headed back towards Carlson's house, determined to find his wife and other children. After searching for a short while I found two sets of tracks. One led to the forest, the other nearby.

Emma (Alfred’s Brave mother) and her Clever twin daughters, Holly and Fern were hiding in the forest nearby. Fern could not flee as she is carrying Giles’s child, and her sister and mother preferred to care for her than abandon her.

Giles Cooperson, their Nervous, Reforming farmhand, hid nearby. He was exiled from Bree for repeated theft, but has started to mend his ways at the Eye, like many before him.

Carlson and his family decided to stay in the tower, where they could secure the strong door behind them. We accompanied them there, wanting to search out this place to find what we could learn (and look for the hidden treasure Gorin reminded me!). Galamdir took first watch on the broken tower and we settled in for some much needed rest.

As we searched the tower the next morning, Galamdir recalled an old rhyme about the tower. Tales tell that the Knight of Rhudaur was allowed to keep an tenth of the tolls he extracted and the old rhyme claims these were hidden behind the third stone up from the floor in the corner of the master’s bedroom, for the successor Kingdoms were forged when Arnor was broken into three Kingdoms and the number three was considered lucky.

We made our way to the bedchamber, but ever the treasure hound, Gorin had already discovered the hidden compartment! Inside was a sturdy wooden chest with black iron strapping. After a minute of effort, Gorin threw open the arched lid. Inside was a small amount of gold, the remains of the Knight's tithe.

On the upper floor, in a corner under a pile of torn banners, we found the body of Eodred. He had been pierced by many arrows, his armor and weapons stripped from his body. Grim news to bring back to Rivendell.

A scream pierced the halls. It was Fern. "Wolves!" she screamed. "Wolves, a whole pack!"

Carlson, his family and Giles ran back into the tower entrance and shut the door tight. "Not again. Not now. We just are rid of those orc-goblin things." bemoaned Emma holding Fern tightly to her chest.

"Never you mind Lassie! Wolves are nothing for warriors such as we! Why we'll make a minced wolf pie when we're finished with 'em! Let's go Ereborn. You too she-elf!"

"Gorin, you dim-witted, bearded gnome..." growled Galadrim.

"Stop it you two. You know you like each other!" I laughed. Then without humor "Let's go wolf hunting!"

Encounter
4 wolves
1 wolf chieftain

Both Galamdir and I targeted the large wolf leader. My arrow missed it's mark but hers flew true and lodged in the great beast's side. Just then another arrow flew from the tower. It was Holly, armed with a hunting bow! Holly's arrow struck the wolf at the base of the neck, slowing him greatly. I wanted to shout "Great shot", but there was no time. The wolves were upon us.

Galamdir, running to the left to avoid the jaws of a wolf, let another arrow fly striking the lead beast in the right flank. He was limping badly now. Gorin swung his great axe and connected with the closest wolf, opening a gash on his back. The wolf tried to bite back but his jaws clamped on only air. A second wolf bit his arm, but the leather armor kept Gorin from injury.

I swing my new-found sword and grievously injured a large wolf. He got his revenge though and bit through my armor. Galamdir, still dancing with another wolf, loosed another arrow at the great wolf that was now attacking me. She struck through the right eye and he dropped to the ground without a sound.

Gorin swung his great axe, cleaving a wolf's head from his body. The head rolled across the field like a child's ball. The other wolf reacted quickly and bit down on his shoulder. Holly shot an arrow at the wolf but missed.

Swinging again at the wolf nearest me, the sword struck true and with a yelp, the animal keeled over, dead.

Galamdir danced to left but this time her wolf met her feint and grabbed her arm just as she tried to knock another arrow. Now only a few feet away, I moved into position behind the beast and swung, but missed. Gorin was now fighting a second wolf. He raised his great axe for a mighty blow but missed as the wolf dodged left. Turning in mid-stride with snakelike speed the wolf clamped his jaws on Gorin's shoulder. The razor sharp teeth hooked under his arm and opened a deep gash as Gorin let out a shout. "Ye smelly fur-covered devil. I'll cleave ye in two for that!" I could see that Gorin was now favoring his arm.

Again my sword found its mark and the wolf jumped back in pain. He weakly lunged at my sword arm, but missed as I drew it back from his jaws. Galamdir, now free from attack, shot an arrow into the wolf's left hind quarter. Gorin's axe came down once more, this time with deadly effect. There was one wolf left.

One more swing of my sword and the field was silent, save for the wind. "This is gonna leave a mark, laddie!" said Gorin as he tried moving his shoulder. Galamdir too looked weary but not seriously damaged. We looked up at the tower to see Holly waving. Carlson and Giles ran out to help Gorin inside, but he shrugged them off. "It's just a scratch." he protested. "I've gotten worse wrestlin' with me wee cousin."

Back in the tower, we looked at Gorin's wounds. They were bad, but should heal in a week or so. We did what we could for now. We decided to spend the night with Carlson and his family. We would return the horses to Bree in the morning. 

The next morning Emma made a simple breakfast of hen's eggs and cheese. It was a welcome feast after the last few days. "If'n you like, I'll take the horse back to the Bree horsemaster. I heard you say you'd like to make your way back to Rivendell. I can't believe I met someone who's actually been there! It must be a sight."

"Thanks Carlson, but I think we'd like to purchase these three. Their good mounts and we could use them on our journey."

" I know that horsemaster John Ferny. He don't take none too kindly with rangers. No sir. But he owes me a favor or two. I'd say a fair price would be two gold a head. He'd surely try to get more out of you. If you want, I'll take it to him. We might spend a night or two in town anyways."

"That's good of you Carlson." Galamdir said quietly and then very sternly she continued "I don't think we've seen the last of that band of orcs here. They left a small guard but I'm certain they'll return with a whole troupe. You might want to stay away for a good while. At least until fall."

Carlson didn't like that. He'd have to leave their farm, but begrudgingly he agreed. Perhaps we could check in on them next time we pass through. 

We stayed one more day to let Gorin recover (though he protested), and to make sure Carlson's family was safe before heading out to Rivendell once again.

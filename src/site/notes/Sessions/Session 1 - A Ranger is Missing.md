## Note About These Session Logs
*The earlier session logs are not quite up to the later logs as far as content and writing goes. I started out recording some of the die rolls, but later decided it was better to forego that and concentrate on the narrative.*
### Log
[[Patrons/Gilraen\|Gilraen]] has given us a quest: A Ranger has gone missing. What has become
of them? She told us he went to the Shire and was supposed to be in Hobbiton. His name is Arondar (Eodred).

We set out on July 1, deciding to follow the road. We would stop at Bree to as around and then continue to Hobbiton. The journey should take about a week, not accounting for stopping in Bree.

EVENT: 
Target: Scout
Event: Joyful Sight
Result: Success
While on the road, just south of the Trollshaws, we saw movement in the trees ahead. Galamdir quieted us. Her keen elf eyes saw that a pure white stag was moving towards the road. We all gasped as the glorious beast crossed the road ahead of us, lifting our spirits. Gorin took this as an omen of good fortune for our quest.

Gain 1 day.

EVENT: 
Target: Scout
Event: Shortcut
Result: Great Success

After we crossed the last bridge, I found a hidden path that allowed to save a day off of our journey.

Gain 1 day.

EVENT: 
Target: Scout
Event: Shortcut
Result: Success

After passing to the south of Weathertop, it seemed the wind was at our backs and we simply flew down the road!

EVENT: 
Target: Lookout
Event: Chance-meeting
Result: Success

About a day out of Bree we had the good fortune of crossing paths with Lander, another ranger from the north. He had seen Eodred in Bree! He suggested we ask around at the Prancing Pony. Eodred had not yet been to Hobbiton but he said helped a family in Bree with a group of ruffians. The family was a woman with 3 children. Their father was killed in a bandit attack and they were just getting by. The ruffians were threatening her and attempting to get her to pay for "protection". Eodred set them straight.

The next day, July 16, we reached Bree.

We asked the barkeep at the Prancing Pony if he had seen Eodred and if he know anything about where he may have gone when he left. He did see him.

Rolls: Mourn, empty, peace.

He said Eodred had sought after a group of ruffians that were bothering a local widow. It seems they stole something from the grave of her dead husband, something that meant a lot to her. They had been threatening her and Eodred wanted to help her. Her name was Elsura Fogbottom. We needed to talk with her.

We found Elsura at her home. She invited us in when we told her we were looking for Eodred. She said the ruffians had stolen a memento from her husbands grave - a locket with a lock of her hair. They said they would give it back - for a price. She had little to give them. Eodred went to find them.

Rolls: Command, Gloomy, Council

Elsura told him they would often meet at night in a dark grove out side the city walls at night, at least that's what she had heard. Eodred went to encourage them to leave her alone. The next day he brought her the locket and said they would leave her alone from now on. He said no more about it. He left, saying he was on his way to Hobbiton.

On to Hobbiton!

The next morning we broke camp and we saw several eagles fly overhead! The sight of such beautiful creatures bolstered our spirits. (no fatigue).

The next day we crossed into the Shire over Brandywine bridge. A cart from Bree came quickly behind us and as it passed, a crate fell of the side and landed on my foot! We stayed an extra day in camp to allow it to heal. Galadir was a great help with her elven medicine. But we lost a day.

Lost one day.

The following day (July 24) we arrived in the Shire and headed to the Green Dragon Inn.

We arrived late on July 24 to the inn, so we headed to our rooms, intending to talk to the innkeeper in the morning. (recover 1 fatigue).

#### Next Morning
We woke early and made our way to the common room to break our fast. I found the innkeeper and asked if he had seen or heard anything about a ranger named Eodred. 

"Aye" he said. "Queer fellow. Liked to stay in the shadows but seemed nice enough when talked to. He was here several weeks ago. Asked if we knew anything about Orcs near [[Weathertop.png|Weathertop]]. Said something about some old tower or some such. Got the idea he was heading there. He was talking with a man named Carlson. He sometimes brings goods from his farm into the Shire to sell. They left together. Carlson is known in Bree. You could ask about him there. He has a farm near Weathertop. Maybe that's why that ranger fellow were talking to  him so much."

It seems Eodred may have gone to this tower. What tower? Where? Somewhere around Weathertop. We could look for it or maybe it would be better to go back to Bree and see if anyone knows this Carlson fellow. He may know exactly where Eodred was headed.

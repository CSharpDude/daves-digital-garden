### Recap
In Session 3 - Rhudaur's Eye, the party set out for Rhudaur's Eye with the boy Alfred. They encountered a camp of orcs outside the tower and successfully defeated them, freeing a captive man. They discovered valuable treasures, including a dwarven ring and a Númenórean long sword. They also found Carlson's family hiding nearby and decided to stay in the tower to search for hidden treasure. They discovered the Knight of Rhudaur's tithe and the body of Eodred. Later, they were attacked by a pack of wolves but managed to defeat them. Gorin sustained injuries but they stayed with Carlson's family until he recovered before heading back to Rivendell.

# Rivendell
We returned to Rivendell on August 13 about midday. What a beautiful sight. I will never get used to seeing the flowing waterfalls and stately ornate buildings. It is time for a rest. But first we need to give [[Patrons/Gilraen\|Gilraen]] the news about Eodred. 

### Gilraen
Gilraen called for us before the evening meal and we delivered the sad news about the ranger Eodred. We also told her what happened with the orcs and Carlson's farm. We believed the orcs were from Mount Gram due to the crude mountain insignia on their shields and their equipment. Since they do not usually travel this far south without a specific purpose, we believe there is more to the story than we yet know. Signs of a larger force indicate they may return at any time, including a force a wargs from the droppings we found around the encampment. Based on the signs we saw, we estimate the full strength of the orcs to be about 3 to 4 dozen with one great orc in command.

"I sent Eodred to the area because of rumors I had heard. I am sorry he met his death there. I will ask other rangers to carefully watch this area. I fear that our beautiful havens are in danger throughout the land."

" What is that you are carrying ranger? How did you acquire this blade?"

"It was among the orc spoils, cast aside as if it were of no value."

"May I see it?" she asked holding out her pale hands. 

"It is Dúnedain and has a magically keen edge. There is more but I cannot see it." offered Galamdir.

"You are right of course. There is more indeed. This is Blade of Arahel from Númenór. It is also called Mán-belthor, the wraith-slayer. It carries a powerful enchantment against undead and certain evil men. But beware. Should the shadow overtake you much, it could turn against you and make you see enemies where there are none."

"Rest now. Take your leave here. We will speak again during the new moon."

> The undead bane removes their ability to spend hate to heal wounds or recover endurance. The evil men bane will give one extra die against evil men.

For the next few days we enjoyed the hospitality of the Elves and the wonders of Rivendell. Gorin recovered from his wounds quickly and fully under Elvish care and their wondrous medicines. Our bond strengthened as we laughed, sang and feasted in the comforts of the Last Homely Home.
> Fellowship +1 

### Meeting Arwen
In the late afternoon of our third day, we all rested in the Upper Solar. Gorin and Galamdir played a game of chess on the Numenorean table. I chuckled at their banter. Gorin was certain he could best her, being much more of a fighter after all. And then a voice rang like the clearest crystal bells ever heard by man or Elendil: "Do you not play Ranger?". I turned, we all turned at the sound to see the most  lovely of sights I have ever seen. Gorin gasped audibly "Oh!". Even Galamdir forsook her usual even demeanor as her face brightened even more, if it were possible. My heart seemed to pause along with time itself as none but Arwen Undómiel stood in the doorway.

"Forgive me. I did not mean to interrupt your leisure." We spoke with her for too few minutes before she took her leave. We looked at each other and I felt a bit embarrassed. Galamdir just smiled and nodded knowingly. Gorin just stared and said nothing for several minutes causing Galamdir to laugh quietly.

> Ereborn and Gorin gain +1 Adventure points.
>Galamdir gains +1 hope (max)

The following day, at the time of the new moon, we were called to meet with Gilraen.
### Gilraen's Call

"I thank you for the information concerning the orcs of Mount Gram. I shall have Ranger patrols increase across Rhudaur. Perhaps a raid into Mount Gram is called for. But that is not for you. Not today at least.

A powerful servant of the enemy has been seen not far from Bree. That one should venture this close within our borders is, unsettling. Why is he here? What is his purpose? I want you to discover what you can and if possible foil whatever plans are in motion. I need you to return to Bree-land and south to Barrow Downs. Ask the Bree-folk as they may have seen or heard of strange goings on in the Downs.

I believe this enemy may not be of the living. Perhaps that is why he has been seen in the Downs. Ereborn, Mán-belthor may prove useful on your journey. Gorin, take care. The enemy has his Eye on you because of what you carry. It is both a boon and a danger. Galamdir, may the light go before you and with you, even in dark places. Galo Anor erin râd lîn. Now I must leave you. Please remain with us until you are fully prepared for your task. Cuio vae - Farewell."

"What did she say to ye lassie?" asked Gorin.

Tilting her head thoughtfully Galamdir explained "She simply said May the sun shine on your path. She seemed to think light is needed where we are to go."

We rested for a few more days and then readied ourselves for our journey. We set off on August 21 early in the morning.

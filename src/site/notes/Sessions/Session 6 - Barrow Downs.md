### Recap
In Session 5 of the Fellowship's journey in Middle-earth, they left Rivendell and embarked on a new journey west. They traveled with sturdy horses and made their way towards Bree, hoping to gather information about the strange occurrences they had encountered. Along the way, they faced challenges such as a flooded road and a lone wolf, but managed to overcome them. Upon reaching Bree, they learned from the innkeeper, Barnabas Butterbur, about strange lights and rumors of a wight-king gathering the dead in the Barrow Downs. They met a trader named Tom Little who confirmed these rumors and pointed them to a specific location on the map. With their next move planned, the Fellowship prepared for their encounter with the unknown.
### Log

We rose early and took a simple breakfast with us on the road. We hoped to reach Tom's indicated point before nightfall. Perhaps we too would hear this sound and see these strange lights. 

#### A Foiled Ambush
As we approached the area we were seeking, the road rounded a rock cliff, blocking our view ahead. "Silence!" motioned Glamdir. Then she signed there were men in the bushes around the blind corner. She motioned for us to move to the side of the road while she silently crept up the rock formation. But sometimes even an elf can send a stone scattering to the ground when she doesn't wish it. 

"Who goes there! Come on down. We ain't gonna hurt ya." shouted one of the men. Peering around the corner we could see others approaching the rock mound. There was nothing for it but to fight.

Galmdir loosed an arrow as she scrambled to gain a foot hold on the loose rock but it went wide. Gorin and I charged around the corner, surprising the group of bandits. Gorin yelled a dwarven battle cry which froze the four men in their tracks. That gave me a perfect target for my bow and I felled the first bandit with one shot.

They closed the distance with us quickly and one swing of Man-belthor I took a bandit out of the fight. Gorin wounded another and Amdiriel's arrow finished him. The remaining two, one hurt badly ran off into the night. I don't think they expected to see a mad dwarf with a great red beard and a ranger come around that corner! "Aw come back here ye cowards! " shouted Gorin. "Bloomin' (dwarven curse)!" 

#### Amdiriel Makes a Joke
Amdiriel jumped down from her perch. "Sorry. I must have been distracted by the lights" she said pointing in the direction of the Barrow Downs. I could barely make out some tiny flickering lights far in the distance, but with her elf eyes she could no doubt see them clear as sunlight. "We should make camp. I don't relish going into the Barrows in the dead of night." Did Amdiriel just make a joke? "I'll take first watch" she said as she scrambled back up the rock formation.

As I lay down I decided I didn't like the sword-name "Man-belthor". I decided to call it Shadow-bane in the common tongue.

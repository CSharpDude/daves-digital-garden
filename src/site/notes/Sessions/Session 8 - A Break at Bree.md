### Recap
In Session 7, the Fellowship continued their journey towards Bree and encountered strange lights in the Barrow Downs. They were attacked by a group of Barrow Men, but managed to defeat them. They then ventured into a large barrow and discovered a Barrow Wight. With the help of the enchanted sword "Man-belthor," they were able to defeat the Wight. They found some treasure, including a ring belonging to the loremaster Duilin of Gondolin. They decided to report their findings to Gilraen and made camp for the night before heading back to Bree.

The day was overcast and it rained on and off. Galamdir was up before dawn and urged us to set out to Bree early. We made our way up the Greenway and arrived at Bree about midday on September 6, a Tuesday. Caked with mud from the road and tired from our adventures, we handed our horses to the hostler and headed to the Pony for some hot food and drink. 

The Prancing Pony is busy every night but even during the day, the common room is still lively with the comings and goings of townsfolk and visitors. There is usually less drinking and noise, making it a better place to relax and have a talk. Gorin ordered the daily special while Galamdir of course ate vegetables, fruit, bread and cheese. I favored the beef and beer pie.

As we ate and talked Galamdir signed "There is a man in the corner who has been watching us. He looks like a ranger." I glanced in his direction and shook my head in assent. The man rose from his chair and approached our table.

"May I sit down? I have word for you from Rivendell." Gorin looked up from his ale and grunted something unintelligible. I noticed Galamdir's hand slide quietly to her dagger.

"Please, sit. May I ask your name sir and who sent you?" I said flatly.

"I am called Basil. I know of you Ereborn. I also trained with Emyrson Tidewater." Lowering his voice he continued "I have word for you from Gilraen. Here is her seal." 

He handed me a letter sealed with the seal of Gilraen the Fair.  Still, I was suspicious. we couldn't chance giving any information to an agent of the Enemy. As if reading my mind, he repeated her words to the three of us before we last left Rivendell. I looked at Galamdir and she nodded to proceed. I read her letter quietly aloud. She asked us to send her word what we had discovered in the Barrows and then wait in Bree until she sent word again.

I questioned Basil further until I was convinced he was indeed a ranger. We agreed we would meet here after dinner and give him a letter for Gilraen. With that he bade us good day and left The Pony. We retired to our rooms to rest and wash up. When we met again after a time, Galamdir produced a letter she had written in Sindarin. I thought that was a good idea. Not everyone could read the Elvish script. It was at best an obfuscation, but it was something. She gave the letter to Basil as planned and we  resigned ourselves to waiting until we heard word once again.

The next day Gorin told us he had begun writing a song about our victory in the Barrows. "It's needin' a wee bit o' tinkerin' to be sure, but what d'ya think Ereborn?" He held it toward me but shielded it from Galamdir with his body. She raised an eyebrow which made Gorin grimace just slightly. I read the song and said it had promise but I wanted to get Galamdir's thoughts. Reluctantly he handed it to her. She smiled and told him there was promise here.

"Ya really think so, Elf? I mean you Elves are very poetic and ya really think so?"

Smiling, her eyes glinting with amusement she said softly "Yes, I do. May I make a few suggestions? You don't have to use them of course."

"Oh, oh, well go ahead then."

The two of them worked on the song for a long time that morning. Just before lunch Gorin presented me with a new version. "I think this is it, Ereborn. What to you think of it? I, *I mean we* call it [[Songs/A Barrow Victory\|A Barrow Victory]]". 

I read it and then Gorin broke into song, bringing the poem to life in music. "Very good Gorin, both of you. This may enliven our hearts next we face such dangerous foe."

> The company now has a Combat song. Heroes succeeding in the song roll ignore the effects of being Weary for the length of the heroic venture (singing a song in combat is considered a secondary action).

Galamdir wanted to visit Reeve's Hall, fabled for a supposed treasure trove of books, manuscripts and maps. Not many knew of this storehouse of knowledge and fewer still have seen it. I said I would join her but Gorin had taken up with a group of dwarves from the west and bade us to go ahead. We set off towards the center of town, the Reeve's Hall being close by on the south side of the road. The day was cloudy with some rain and felt cool for early September or as he Elves call it in Sindarin, *Ivanneth.* It seemed a good day to study maps and books, sitting by a warm fire with hot cup of mint leaf tea.

We spent the better part of the day in the library as Galamdir poured over the rare writings and maps of the area. I confess that I fell asleep after a couple of hours. I was awakened when Marigold Finch, the mistress of the hall, asked if we would like some more tea. We both agreed and Galamdir chuckled as I awoke from my slumber. "I think perhaps you should take first watch from now on." she laughed. Her laughter had he sound of a crystal clear brook running down a rocky mountainside. It made me smile.

September 22: And so we passed two weeks in Bree before we received word from the Lady Gilraen.

## About the Campaign
This campaign is being played in Strider Mode, a set of solo rules for The One Ring Roleplaying System by Free League. Strider mode normally has one player hero and perhaps one or two companions, but only the player here is a full character. I prefer to play with a party and so I have created three player-heroes. The game is then played as if it were cooperative play using the Strider rules.

### Other Tools Used

- **Foundry VTT** - The game is played in Foundry VTT with the Eriador travel map, a battle map showing the stances of the company, and a few other scenes for flavor. 
- **Mythic GME** - The Strider mode tables or the Core Rules tables are normally used when a random event occurs or information about something is needed that would usually come from a Loremaster. Mythic GME is used to supplement those tables from time to time.
- **ChatGPT** - My virtual Loremaster. Chat GPT is queried when I want a description of something company has encountered such as the location of a group of evil men. I sometimes ask it to provide a quest from one of the company's patrons. I find it adds a new dimension to solo role playing.

## Background
[[Company/Ereborn\|Ereborn]], a skilled ranger of the North, had dedicated his life to hunting down the orcs that had destroyed his village and taken his family from him. His relentless pursuit of vengeance led him to cross paths with [[Company/Amdiriel\|Amdiriel]], an elf of Lindon, who shared his desire to protect Middle-earth from the encroaching darkness. Amdiriel's skills as an archer and wise counselor complemented Ereborn's abilities, and they quickly formed a bond.

Meanwhile, [[Company/Gorin\|Gorin]], a dwarf of Durin's Folk, had always been drawn to the thrill of treasure hunting. His insatiable curiosity and knack for deciphering ancient runes made him an invaluable member of any expedition. When Ereborn and Amdiriel heard of Gorin's expertise from other rangers, they knew he would be a valuable addition to their group.

Their paths converged when they caught the attention of [[Patrons/Gilraen\|Gilraen]], the mother of Aragorn and a respected figure among the DÃºnedain. Gilraen recognized the potential in Ereborn, Amdiriel, and Gorin and saw in them the strength and determination needed to fight against the growing darkness. She became their patron, guiding them and providing them with resources and support.

Under Gilraen's guidance, the trio embarked on a quest to uncover the truth behind the presence of a powerful servant of the enemy near Bree. As they journeyed through the lands of Middle-earth, facing treacherous creatures and ancient evils, their bond grew stronger. Ereborn's skills as a ranger, Amdiriel's archery prowess, and Gorin's treasure-hunting abilities proved to be a formidable combination.

Throughout their adventures, Gilraen's wisdom and foresight guided them, ensuring their safety and success. She encouraged them to defend the weak and fight against the enemy, instilling in them a sense of purpose and duty. With each victory, Ereborn, Amdiriel, and Gorin became more united, their shared experiences forging a deep camaraderie.

Together, they faced countless challenges, their skills and determination tested at every turn. But with Gilraen as their patron, they found the strength to overcome any obstacle. As they continued their quest to protect Middle-earth, their names became known and whispered in hushed tones among both friends and enemies.

And so, Ereborn, Amdiriel, and Gorin, bound by their shared purpose and guided by the wisdom of Gilraen, ventured forth as a fellowship, their hearts filled with hope and their resolve unyielding.

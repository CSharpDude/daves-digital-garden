"_Gandalf was shorter in stature than the [other](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elrond "Elrond") [two](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Glorfindel "Glorfindel"); but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his eyes were set like coals that could suddenly burst into fire._"

### Gandalf the Grey
At the end of the second week in September a cart came
in through Bywater from the direction of the Brandywine
Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all
alone. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a long grey cloak,
and a silver scarf.

To the Hobbits of the Shire, Gandalf the Grey is just a pil-
grim, a wanderer without a home. He says he’s a Wizard,
but the extent of his magical skill seems to be limited to
his wonderful fireworks and to the prodigious smoke-­
rings he produces with his pipe. But the wanderings of
Gandalf have brought him much farther than his beloved
Shire, to lands where he is known by different names: to
the Elves he is Mithrandir, Tharkûn is how the Dwarves
know him, and Men in the South call him Gandalf Grey-
hame. In these countries, Gandalf is not always welcome
— indeed, some call him a bringer of ill-­n ews, as he often
comes when a threat is near.

In truth, Gandalf is the greatest enemy of Sauron
in the Third Age. Few among the Wise know that the
Wizards first came to Middle-­e arth out of the Utter-
most West almost two thousand years ago, on a mis-
sion to thwart the Dark Lord’s machinations. Gandalf's
appointed task is to bolster the hearts of those who
would fight against evil everywhere, and that’s what he
has done for centuries now, counseling Dwarves, Elves,
and Men, always bringing light where darkness lies.
Gandalf is the secret bearer of Narya, the Ring of Fire,
the third Elven-­r ing created by Celebrimbor of Eregion.
It was given to him for safekeeping and for his own use
by Círdan the Shipwright. Narya is an invaluable aid to
Gandalf in his mission to inspire others in their struggles
against the Shadow. If pressed into combat, the Grey
Pilgrim unsheaths Glamdring, an ancient Elven blade,
forged in Gondolin for the Goblin-­wars.

GANDALF THE GREY: Adventurer, Wizard
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Bold, Cunning, Wise

ENCOUNTERING GANDALF
Gandalf can be encountered almost anywhere — riding
across the countryside on horseback, walking alone or in
the company of friends or allies, or even in the seat of a
horse-­drawn cart. He may not show up when called but often
appears when needed. Gandalf holds a particular fondness
for the Hobbits of the Shire and when he is meeting some-
one in Eriador, he will always choose the inn in Bree as a
meeting place.

When encountered along the road, the Grey Wizard may
appear just as an old man, with a long white beard and car-
rying a staff that he sometimes leans upon as he walks. But
when he sits in council, his white hair and piercing dark eyes
make him look like a wise king from some ancient legend.
Gandalf does not resort to using magic lightly, as he fears
it would betray his presence to the eyes of the Enemy. When
he does, he displays a mastery of fire and smoke, a reflection
of his personality. Seemingly irascible, the old Wizard is also
just as quick to burst into warm laughter. He might gently
chide a friend, offer words of reassurance, then wax wroth
at those who fail to show him due respect.

GANDALF AS A PATRON
Once, Círdan of the Havens said that the Grey Wanderer’s
mission is to ‘rekindle hearts in a world that grows chill’. In
accordance with this mandate, Gandalf labours to inspire
all individuals into action, and set events in motion that will
eventually spiral into greater consequences. The Quest of
Erebor is an example of how Gandalf acts — helping Thorin
Oakenshield to reclaim his lost kingdom led to the elimina-
tion of a Dragon that could have become a terrible weapon
in the hands of the Enemy.

Unlike the head of his order, Saruman, who deals in
devices and instruments from his high tower in Isengard,
Gandalf moves among those who oppose Sauron, listening
to their pleas and providing help when emergencies occur.
This has made Gandalf welcome in most places, despite his
reputation as a troublemaker.

A member of the White Council, Gandalf is the one
among the Wise that is most likely to act promptly. While
the others may counsel patience and caution, Gandalf moves
decisively, putting himself in danger, infiltrating the lairs of
the Enemy, and facing evil without hesitation. His goal is to
lead the Free Peoples by example, encouraging them to set
aside ancient rivalries and petty disputes, and to work together
in defence of all that is good and worth keeping.

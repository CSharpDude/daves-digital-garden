### Gilraen the Fair
After a few years Gilraen took leave of Elrond and
returned to her own people in Eriador, and lived alone…
A woman of noble lineage, Gilraen is the mother of
Aragorn, the current chieftain of the Rangers of the
North and Heir of Isildur. She was quite young when she
married, and became a widow soon after she gave birth
to her son. When that came to pass, Elrond took her and
her newborn to dwell with him in Rivendell, and he raised
Aragorn as a son of his own — Aragorn was called ‘Estel’
in Imladris (Sindarin for ‘Hope’), to conceal his lineage
and true name from his enemies.

In the year 2965, Gilraen is not yet sixty years old.
Being one of the long lived Dúnedain, she is in the fulness
of her strength of body and mind, and possesses a
measure of the foresight of her people. When her son
left Rivendell to seek adventure a few years ago, Gilraen
decided to remain in Imladris. She often leaves the Last
Homely House on short trips, to visit her own people in
Eriador and confer with the captains of the Rangers of
the North, in the absence of their chieftain.

GILRAEN THE FAIR: Counselor, Seer
DISTINCTIVE FEATURES: Cautious, Fair, Steadfast
ENCOUNTERING GILRAEN

Gilraen is accorded great respect among the Dúnedain
of Eriador as the widow of Arathorn, their previous chieftain,
and as the mother of the Heir of Isildur. She is
also deemed to be foresighted, having inherited that gift
from Ivorwen, her mother. Many captains of the Rangers
seek her advice, knowing her to be a wise and prudent
counselor.

Anyone who meets her will find Gilraen to be a tall and
slender woman, her demeanour marked by sorrow, but who
refuses to be bent under the weight of her misfortune.

Gilraen can be met in the company of small bands of
Rangers, along the many paths trod by her folk in the vicinity
of Rivendell, or in the Weather Hills and the North Downs.
She never stays away for more than a few weeks at a time
though, always returning to the safety of the house of Elrond
to rest.

GILRAEN AS A PATRON
Having lost her husband Arathorn to an Orc-arrow,
and his father Arador to the ferocity of Hill-trolls
in the Coldfells, Gilraen has experienced personally the hatred of the Enemy
for her folk. She knows full well that the Dúnedain of the
North and the entire region of Eriador will never be safe
if evil creatures are allowed to prowl undisturbed. In the
absence of her son the chieftain, Gilraen makes sure that
the Rangers don’t forsake their duty as guardians of the
land of old Arnor and the borders of the Bree-land
and the Shire. In this, she has found a staunch ally in the Wizard
Gandalf. When she is in Rivendell, she never misses a chance
to encourage the sons of Elrond to go out and hunt all
monstrous creatures.

Adventurers worthy of Gilraen’s trust find themselves
enjoying the respect of the Rangers of the North. When
out in the wild, they can count on the help of many scouts,
and are provided directions to find their hidden refuges
and caches of supplies.

## Description
**Elrond** was the [half-elven](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Half-elven "Half-elven") son of [Eärendil](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/E%C3%A4rendil "Eärendil") and [Elwing](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elwing "Elwing"), the father of [Arwen](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arwen "Arwen"), and the Lord of [Rivendell](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Rivendell "Rivendell") who consistently fought against [Sauron](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sauron "Sauron") throughout the Second and Third Ages. He was the twin brother of [Elros](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elros "Elros"), who later became the first king of [Númenor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/N%C3%BAmenor "Númenor").[[5\|5]](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elrond#cite_note-Earendil-5)

Having been born in [Beleriand](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Beleriand "Beleriand") towards the end of the [First Age](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/First_Age "First Age"), Elrond ever opposed [Sauron](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sauron "Sauron") and strove against him throughout the [Second Age](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Second_Age "Second Age"), helping to bring about Sauron's defeat in the [War of the Last Alliance](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/War_of_the_Last_Alliance "War of the Last Alliance") as [Gil-galad](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gil-galad "Gil-galad")'s herald. Elrond inherited Gil-galad's Elven ring [Vilya](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Vilya "Vilya"), and during the [Third Age](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Third_Age "Third Age") he fought against the [Witch-king](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Witch-king "Witch-king") of [Angmar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Angmar "Angmar") and, as a member of the [White Council](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/White_Council "White Council"), expelled the Necromancer from [Dol Guldur](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Dol_Guldur "Dol Guldur") (who was Sauron in another guise). Towards the end of the Third Age, he was the foster-father to [Aragorn](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aragorn "Aragorn") as he had been to Arathorn before him. Aragorn went on to marry Elrond's daughter Arwen. After the destruction of [the One Ring](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_One_Ring "The One Ring"), Elrond sailed west with [Gandalf](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Gandalf "Gandalf"), [Bilbo](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins "Bilbo Baggins"), [Frodo](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Frodo_Baggins "Frodo Baggins"), and [Galadriel](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Galadriel "Galadriel"); their passing marked the end of the Third Age and the beginning of the [Fourth](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Fourth_Age "Fourth Age").

Elrond is one of the most prominent, significant and recognisable characters in [J.R.R. Tolkien](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/J.R.R._Tolkien "J.R.R. Tolkien")'s legendarium, appearing in _[The Hobbit](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Hobbit "The Hobbit")_, _[The Lord of the Rings](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings "The Lord of the Rings")_, _[The Silmarillion](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Silmarillion "The Silmarillion")_ and _[Unfinished Tales](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Unfinished_Tales "Unfinished Tales")_. He was critical to providing [Thorin and Company](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Thorin_and_Company "Thorin and Company") with the information they needed to enter the [Lonely Mountain](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Lonely_Mountain "Lonely Mountain"), and the [Council of Elrond](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Council_of_Elrond "Council of Elrond") brought about the creation of the [Fellowship of the Ring](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Fellowship_of_the_Ring "Fellowship of the Ring"), which ultimately resulted in the destruction of the One Ring and the final defeat of Sauron.

## Characteristics[edit](https://tolkiengateway.net/w/index.php?title=Elrond&veaction=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Characteristics")[edit source](https://tolkiengateway.net/w/index.php?title=Elrond&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Characteristics")

"_He was as noble and fair as an elf-lord, as strong as a warrior, as wise as a wizard, as venerable as a king of dwarves, and as kind as summer._"

― _[The Hobbit](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/The_Hobbit "The Hobbit")_, "[A Short Rest](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/A_Short_Rest "A Short Rest")"

Elrond seemed ageless, resembling neither old nor young. However, one could see in his face the memories and experiences of thousands of years. He looked venerable both like an old king, a wise wizard, and an experienced warrior in his prime.

Elrond is described as dark-haired, while his eyes were grey, shining like starlight. He could be seen wearing a circlet of silver.[[3\|3]](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elrond#cite_note-meetings-3)[[17\|17]](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elrond#cite_note-17)

His parents were [Eärendil](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/E%C3%A4rendil "Eärendil") and [Elwing](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elwing "Elwing"). He was thus [Half-elven](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Half-elven "Half-elven"): Eärendil was the child of the mortal [Tuor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Tuor "Tuor") and the elf [Idril](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Idril "Idril"), while Elwing was the grandchild of [Beren](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Beren "Beren") (a [Man](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Man "Man")) and [Lúthien](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/L%C3%BAthien "Lúthien") (daughter of the Elf-king [Thingol](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Thingol "Thingol") and the Maia [Melian](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Melian "Melian")). Consequently, Elrond was descended from all three tribes of the Elves ([Vanyar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Vanyar "Vanyar") and [Noldor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Noldor "Noldor") through Idril, [Sindar](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Sindar "Sindar") through Lúthien), a Maia, and all three houses of the [Edain](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Edain "Edain") ([Hador](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/House_of_Hador "House of Hador"), [Haleth](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/House_of_Haleth "House of Haleth") and [Bëor](https://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/House_of_B%C3%ABor "House of Bëor")).

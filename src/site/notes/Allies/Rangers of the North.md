*…in the wild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers.
The Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing of their origin.*

## Description

The Rangers of the North are a secret people, severely diminished
in number with the passing of a thousand years. They
wander in disguise among the ruins of what was once their
kingdom of Arnor, tirelessly patrolling its many paths and
roads.

While the years have lengthened, the task of the Rangers
has always been the same: to keep the folk of Eriador free
from care and fear. They labour secretly, keeping to themselves,
and rarely giving their names to the travellers they
save or to the folk whose farms they guard at night, when
evil things come out from dark places.
characteristics

The Rangers are the last descendants in the North of the
Dúnedain, kings among Men that once came to Middle-earth
over the Sea out of Westernesse. When they do not disguise
their features, they are tall and lordly, towering above most
Men. They are often silent and grim of countenance, and
look wise and mature beyond their years.

Rangers take to the Wild around the age of twenty, but
may begin to go on adventures even at a younger age. They
retain their strength of body and will longer than most Men,
but usually cease to travel far from Eriador when they reach
their fifties. When in the Wild, they wear comfortable but
weather-beaten garments, favouring high leather boots and
heavy cloaks of dark grey or green cloth, with ample hoods
that can be cast over a worn helm.

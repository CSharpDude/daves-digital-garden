### Description
Gorin is a stout dwarf with a flaming red beard. His axe is almost as dangerous as his tongue!

### Backstory
Gorin, a male Dwarf of Durin's Folk, possesses an insatiable thirst for adventure and a deep love for the thrill of hunting for treasure. From a young age, he was captivated by tales of lost riches and ancient artifacts hidden deep within the mountains. Gorin's natural curiosity and keen eye for detail made him an exceptional treasure hunter, as he tirelessly scoured the depths of forgotten tombs, treacherous ruins, and perilous caverns in search of his next great discovery.

His passion for treasure hunting led Gorin to form a close bond with his fellow Dwarves, who shared his love for the hunt. Together, they embarked on countless expeditions, braving the dangers of the wild and facing off against formidable foes. Gorin's prowess with his trusty pickaxe and his uncanny ability to decipher ancient runes and symbols made him an invaluable member of any treasure-hunting party.

However, Gorin's desire for wealth was not solely driven by greed. He understood that the treasures he sought held historical and cultural significance, and he felt a deep responsibility to preserve and protect these relics of the past. Gorin's dream was not just to amass riches, but to uncover the hidden stories and secrets that lay within each treasure he found. With each discovery, he hoped to shed light on the forgotten history of his people and to honor the legacy of Durin's Folk.

### Description
Ereborn is one of the [[Allies/Rangers of the North\|Rangers of the North]] and is the leader of the company.

### Backstory
Ereborn, a male ranger of the North, was born in the rugged wilderness of Eriador. From a young age, he displayed an innate connection with nature, often disappearing for days on end to explore the untamed lands surrounding his village. Ereborn's father, a skilled hunter and tracker, recognized his son's potential and began training him in the ways of the ranger. Under his father's guidance, Ereborn honed his skills in swordplay, archery, hunting, and stealth, becoming a formidable force in the wild.

Tragedy struck when Ereborn's village was attacked by a band of marauding orcs. In the chaos, Ereborn's family perished, leaving him as the sole survivor. Consumed by grief and seeking vengeance, he dedicated his life to eradicating the foul creatures that had torn his world apart. Ereborn roamed the wilds, tracking down orc warbands and striking from the shadows with deadly precision. Over time, he earned a reputation as a relentless and feared hunter, his name whispered in hushed tones among the enemies of the Free Peoples.

However, Ereborn's solitary existence took a turn when he stumbled upon a group of fellow adventurers on a quest to safeguard the lands from the encroaching darkness. Drawn to their cause, Ereborn joined their ranks, finding solace in the camaraderie and shared purpose. Together, they ventured into the heart of Mirkwood, facing treacherous creatures and ancient evils. Ereborn's skills as a ranger proved invaluable, guiding the party through the perilous forest and ensuring their survival. With each victory, Ereborn felt a glimmer of hope rekindling within him, as he realized that even in the darkest of times, the light of fellowship could prevail.
